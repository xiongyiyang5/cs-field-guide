A Regular Expression,
abbreviated to RE, regexp, regex and more,

00:07.200 --> 00:14.200
is commonly used in software development and
searching algorithms for matching patterns in text;

00:14.200 --> 00:19.800
they are particularly important for
implementing programming languages.

00:19.800 --> 00:25.200
Regular Expressions are powerful formulae
for defining patterns to search for,

00:25.200 --> 00:32.400
yet they are also very simple; they can be
defined with combinations of just four symbols:

00:32.400 --> 00:38.800
the ‘Kleene star’ (shown as an asterisk),
<00:36.000>‘alternation’ (a vertical bar)

00:38.800 --> 00:43.400
and the open & closed parentheses.

00:43.400 --> 00:48.400
Say we want to search these
Terms and Conditions for important dates.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.400
For simplicity we’ll only worry about numerical dates.

00:52.400 --> 00:57.600
There are only a few different formats
we can expect dates to be in right?

00:57.600 --> 01:01.800
We just search for day-day-month-month-year-year.

01:01.800 --> 01:07.800
However it could be day-day-month-month-year-year-year-year
if you’re being formal,

01:07.800 --> 01:12.800
or maybe just day-day-month-month
if you don’t need the year.

01:12.800 --> 01:20.200
But the first month digit can only be 0 or 1
and the first day digit can only be 0 to 3.

01:20.200 --> 01:26.600
Sometimes people ignore the 0 if the date is
only one digit, so it could just be day-month.

01:26.600 --> 01:33.000
But for other people the month comes <i>before</i> the day
so we have to account for that too.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.600
My word it’s all so complicated isn’t it?

01:36.600 --> 01:43.800
Thankfully, we can use Regular Expressions to
simplify writing rules for the patterns we want to match.

01:43.800 --> 01:50.400
This series of videos explores the idea more closely,
looking at the meaning of these basic symbols,

01:50.400 --> 01:58.800
some common extended syntax, and the close connection
between Regular Expressions and Finite State Automata.

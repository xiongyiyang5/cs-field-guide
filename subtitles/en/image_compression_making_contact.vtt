Image Compression - Making Contact

00:08.600 --> 00:12.800
Is anyone from outer space trying
to make contact with us?

00:12.800 --> 00:16.800
A science-fiction writer called Carl Sagan
suggested that if someone was,

00:16.800 --> 00:20.600
they might send us a picture coded as numbers.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.800
In fact, we already have digital systems
for sending pictures as numbers.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.600
One of them is called a fax machine.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.000
Suppose you wanted to send this picture
over a long distance.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.400
Here it has been broken up into lots of
black and white squares, called <i>pixels.</i>

00:36.400 --> 00:41.000
Rather than transmit every pixel separately,
we can speed things up by grouping pixels

00:41.000 --> 00:44.200
in runs of the same colour.

00:44.200 --> 00:50.800
Here we have a run of three white pixels,
then four black ones, then one white.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.600
Now the picture is represented with
a whole lot of numbers,

00:53.600 --> 00:58.400
which makes it easy to store and transmit.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.600
Here we're going to send this picture
from the paper to the side of a wall.

01:02.600 --> 01:07.600
The printer at the other end is a student,
who will paint black and white pixels for us.

01:07.600 --> 01:16.000
The first message is the number of white pixels to skip,
then we send a message to colour in three black pixels.

01:17.600 --> 01:23.000
We carry on alternating numbers for white,
then black pixels.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.800
The person sending the image just needs to count
the number of white squares until the next black one.

01:28.800 --> 01:34.000
Then the number of black squares
until the next white one.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.600
It's always alternating: white, and black.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
These pixels are more than a thousand times
larger than the ones on a fax machine.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.200
Even though we've only sent a few numbers,
we've communicated the whole picture.

01:50.200 --> 01:56.400
Of course, in class you don't have
to use a sheet of paper this big.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.600
Fax machines use a similar principle
for sending pictures.

01:59.600 --> 02:04.400
If they sent each pixel individually,
they'd be about seven times slower.

02:04.400 --> 02:09.400
And if you need to contact someone in outer space,
perhaps you'd want to use this system too.

02:09.400 --> 02:13.000

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Artificial Intelligence

00:02.000 --> 00:08.600
Some people think that one day
computers will be as intelligent as humans.

00:08.600 --> 00:12.000
Do you think that will happen?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.600
I don't think so.

00:14.600 --> 00:20.400
Hmm
Do you think that will happen?

00:20.400 --> 00:23.800
Of course, I'm more intelligent than any TV presenter.

00:23.800 --> 00:24.800
[Gasps]

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
Ouch, it hurts.
Well not really, I'm a robot. [laughs]

00:32.000 --> 00:35.200
Okay, what is the capital of New Zealand?

00:35.200 --> 00:40.200
What kind of question is that?
Everybody knows that the capital of New Zealand

00:40.200 --> 00:41.600
is Wellington.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.000
Okay, what's 4x5?

00:44.000 --> 00:51.200
Seriously, I'm not a calculator. I'm a robot,
I'm capable of doing amazing things.

00:51.200 --> 00:55.200
I'm going to answer you just because
I know that you are a human who is

00:55.200 --> 00:58.200
not capable of answering this question.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.000
[Gasps]

01:01.000 --> 01:02.800
The answer is 20.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.200
Who is your father?

01:12.800 --> 01:15.400
Tell me more about your family.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.800
What? No, no I asked you who is your father?

01:19.800 --> 01:21.800
Tell me more about your family.

01:21.800 --> 01:22.600
What?

01:22.600 --> 01:27.600
At the moment, computers don't have
the general intelligence of humans.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.800
But they can do some jobs
that require specialised intelligence.

01:31.800 --> 01:38.400
Such as: playing board games;
speech recognition for telephone answering;

01:38.400 --> 01:43.200
analysing buying patterns
and making reccomendations for online shopping;

01:43.200 --> 01:47.200
video games;
logistics planning and scheduling;

01:47.200 --> 01:54.000
recognising what's in an image;
intelligent controllers for driving cars.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.600
In this chapter, we'll look at some applications
and also think about what it means

01:58.600 --> 02:01.400
for software to be intelligent.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.000
We'll also think about ethical issues.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.200
Do we really want to build something
that is as intelligent as us?

02:08.200 --> 02:11.000
Do we want to be giving our jobs to robots?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.300
Should robots be treated as equals?

02:14.300 --> 02:15.300
Mary?

02:15.300 --> 02:17.600
Yes?

02:17.600 --> 02:19.600
Will you be my friend?

02:19.600 --> 02:23.500
Sure thing Martin.
Anyway, let's start by looking

02:23.500 --> 02:25.400
Mary?

02:25.400 --> 02:28.000
Yes?

02:36.400 --> 02:40.000
Will you be my girlfriend?

03:44.600 --> 03:47.600
Woah, I'll get back to you.

03:47.600 --> 03:54.000
Anyway, let's start with some practical applications.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.600
Artificial Intelligence

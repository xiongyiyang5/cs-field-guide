00:00.200 --> 00:04.400
If you have any experience
with text-based programming,

00:04.400 --> 00:09.400
calculations in Excel,
or even writing sentences in Word,

00:09.400 --> 00:13.200
you may have encountered the dreaded <i>Syntax Error</i>,

00:13.200 --> 00:18.200
where you accidentally left out a bracket
or misspelled a word.

00:18.200 --> 00:22.600
Even before your computer runs your code
or makes that calculation,

00:22.600 --> 00:28.600
it knows that youâ€™ve made a mistake;
and it can often tell you exactly where it is.

00:28.600 --> 00:34.000
We can use Finite State Automata
to find some of these errors.

00:00.000 --> 00:10.400
Let’s take a look at another common example, URLs.
<00:05.800>Here is a regular expression for URLs I came up with earlier.

00:10.400 --> 00:16.600
It isn’t perfect, perhaps by the end of this video
you’ll have figured out some things that are missing,

00:16.600 --> 00:21.400
but it’s a good starting example so let’s take a look.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.800
Before we do though we need to make
one more clarification.

00:25.800 --> 00:33.000
Apart from some cases such as backslash d,
the backslash is used as an escape character

00:33.000 --> 00:36.400
and so the following symbol is matched ‘as-is.’

00:36.400 --> 00:44.600
We found before that the period matches any single character,
but backslash period matches the period itself.

00:44.600 --> 00:51.400
This is the same for backslash forwardslash,
as forwardslash normally matches the division symbol.

00:51.400 --> 01:04.400
So, first we have the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP,
with zero or one of an S, followed by colon, forwardslash forwardslash.

01:04.400 --> 01:12.000
This is the part of the URL you see before the actual web address.
This entire sequence can be left out,

01:12.000 --> 01:16.800
so it is enclosed in parentheses
and followed by a question mark.

01:16.800 --> 01:23.000
The next sequence, the main web address,
is a combination of characters and symbols.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.200
We have a choice between a letter or a digit
or a period or a hyphen or a forwardslash,

NOTE the hyphen was accidentally left out in the drawing

01:29.200 --> 01:37.000
but we almost certainly need more than one,
so it is wrapped in parentheses and given a plus symbol.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.400
After this there is a period, then the suffix.
.com is the most common example in business,

NOTE 'in business' was accidentally left out in the audio

01:43.400 --> 01:53.600
but there are many many regional alternatives;
such as .co.nz for New Zealand and .co.uk for the United Kingdom.

01:53.600 --> 01:59.600
In this series of videos we took a look at
the basic meaning of Regular Expressions,

01:59.600 --> 02:05.600
what they’re used for, as well as some of
the many different symbols used in practical systems,

02:05.600 --> 02:10.000
though they all can be expressed in terms of just four.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.600
For more information and examples,
check out the Computer Science Field Guide.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.200
Regular Expressions is in the chapter on Formal Languages.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.000
Thanks for watching!

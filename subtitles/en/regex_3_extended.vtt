00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
Let’s say we want to match every number in a text.

00:04.600 --> 00:09.600
Numbers are made up of
one or more digits concatenated together.

00:09.600 --> 00:21.000
Using our basic regex symbols that would be any digit:
<00:14.000>0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9,

00:21.000 --> 00:31.600
concatenated with zero or more of any digit:
<00:24.800>0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 star.

00:31.600 --> 00:36.400
Now this is <i>far</i> too long for a busy computer scientist.

00:36.400 --> 00:44.600
Thankfully, we can use some extended regex syntax
to describe this and others using only a few symbols.

00:44.600 --> 00:57.400
In many systems, a list of symbols between square brackets,
like [0,1,2,3,4,5] means “choose one from this list,”

00:57.400 --> 01:07.800
and we can shorten this further to [0-5],
which means “choose any symbol in the range 0 to 5."

01:07.800 --> 01:16.000
But in our example, we want any single digit,
so we can use another code: backslash d (\d).

01:16.000 --> 01:26.200
\d(\d)* is so much shorter now,
but it still matches exactly the same pattern!

01:26.200 --> 01:32.400
In fact we can shorten it even more
by introducing the plus notation.

01:32.400 --> 01:40.600
While A* matches zero or more As,
A+ matches one or more As.

01:40.600 --> 01:49.000
So we can now write our regex formula
that will match any number as (\d)+.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.800
Other common symbols are: the question mark,
which matches an optional occurrence of the symbol;

01:55.800 --> 02:02.600
a number in curly braces, which matches exactly
that number of the previous symbol;

02:02.600 --> 02:08.800
and the period or full stop,
which matches any single character once.

02:08.800 --> 02:17.000
Remember, all of these extended regex symbols
may be pretty fancy, and they shorten things a lot.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.800
But they are really just shortcuts that could be
written longhand using the four basic symbols;

02:23.800 --> 02:27.600
bar, star and the parentheses.

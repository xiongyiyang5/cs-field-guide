00:00.000 --> 00:01.200
Network Protocols

00:01.200 --> 00:04.400
Talking is easy, right?
We all do it every day.

00:04.400 --> 00:08.000
Whether it's in person, by email, or by text.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.200
But what happens when something goes wrong?

00:10.200 --> 00:15.200
What happens when what we're using to communicate
<00:12.400>just isn't reliable <00:13.400>reliable <00:14.000>relelelelelel.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.800
We use protocols.

00:16.800 --> 00:21.000
Protocols is a fancy word for a simple concept:
<00:19.600>Communicating formally.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
<i>The stock market's doing so poorly,
whatever shall I do?</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:29.800
Not like that.
<00:28.400>Pilots use protocols.

00:29.800 --> 00:33.000
Their communication has to be reliable and efficient.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.600
They have to be able to communicate
with other planes and various airports

00:36.600 --> 00:39.600
in order to stay safe.

00:39.600 --> 00:45.400
For example: how do they report their position?
What happens if they don't understand what was said?

00:45.400 --> 00:47.600
What happens if they don't hear back?

00:47.600 --> 00:50.000
You can get into some pretty awkward situations.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.400
- So what runway should we use?
<00:52.000>- [Incomprehensible]

00:54.400 --> 00:56.800
I think he said 'land on the cake'

00:56.800 --> 01:01.000
Okay, we're landing on the cake.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.800
What now?

01:05.800 --> 01:08.200
To avoid this, we use protocols.

01:08.200 --> 01:13.600
Protocols are a way to formalise communication,
such that we don't get ourselves in trouble.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.000
That's why pilots are always repeating stuff.
<01:15.800>Always repeating stuff.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.200
And use special codewords to avoid being misheard.

01:20.200 --> 01:25.000
Christchurch tower, charlie charlie alpha approaching
eastern fire break, one thousand five hundred.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.400
We have Information Julie at 1-0-3-4 in 4-B-O-B.
Request landing on runway.

01:31.400 --> 01:38.800
Pilots, emergency services, law enforcement, surgeons,
builders and even you use protocols every day.

01:38.800 --> 01:42.800
They are essential to effective
and efficient communication.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.600
Scalpel.

01:48.200 --> 01:52.000
A lot of people think the internet is bulletproof.
<01:50.800>But it's not.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.600
Messages are lost, corrupted,
and delivered out of order all the time.

01:56.600 --> 02:01.000
Think about when you send a message on Facebook.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.600
If we didn't have protocols,
it would look something like this:

02:07.600 --> 02:13.600
[H3y *>%thony, How a$$re you?!?]

02:13.600 --> 02:17.800
Luckily, the message arrives on
the other side of the world just fine.

02:17.800 --> 02:25.800
The protocol is in place to ensure each word or letter
is delivered properly, and if need be, they are resent.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.600
In this chapter, you'll learn about
protocols such as TCP and UP,

02:29.600 --> 02:33.000
which are used to build
awesome applications on the web.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
Even people in the film industry use protocols.
For example, to finish filming people say cut.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.600
- He said cut!
<02:39.400>All sorts of people use protocols.
<02:41.000>- Good for me

02:41.600 --> 02:43.800
- I think that's a wrap.
But in this chapter,<02:42.200> guys?
<02:42.200>- Yep, audio's good.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.200
Guys?
- See you tommorrow Sam.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.600
Are we still filming?

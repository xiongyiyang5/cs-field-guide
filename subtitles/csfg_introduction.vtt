00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
Welcome to our guide to Computer Science.

00:02.700 --> 00:05.400
One of the main reasons that
we've created this guide is that

00:05.400 --> 00:09.200
although computers are a big part
of our lives and in the world all around us,

00:09.200 --> 00:13.000
A lot of people don't really understand
what Computer Science is.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
<i>I was going to take Computer Science but,</i>
<00:15.400><i>I basically already know how to use Word and Excel.</i>

00:18.000 --> 00:22.200
And it is one of those things that
you don't really notice until it's missing.

00:22.200 --> 00:32.200
For example then you end up with things like
<00:24.400>really.<00:27.200> Slow.<00:29.800> Programs.

00:36.200 --> 00:46.600
Or, incredibly,<00:39.200> frustrating,<00:44.600> interfaces.

00:51.200 --> 00:55.600
Or, systems, that can't cope with
large amounts of data.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.600
And these days, a business can become
a thousand times bigger overnight.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.600
That's exactly when you need it
to be able to cope with a lot of data.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.000
We'll look at topics like: Computer Security,

01:06.000 --> 01:10.400
to make sure that any personal information
you're holding can't be accessed by hackers;

01:10.400 --> 01:14.800
or Artificial Intelligence,
for planning and decision making;

01:14.800 --> 01:19.600
Computer Graphics, for entertainment
and also visualising large amounts of data;

01:19.600 --> 01:26.200
and Computer Vision, where a computer can sense
objects and even people in the world around it.

01:26.200 --> 01:30.200
We'll look at computer programs that take so long to run
that they won't finish in a lifetime,

01:30.200 --> 01:32.600
even on the fastest computer.

01:32.600 --> 01:36.000
We'll think about what it means for a computer
to be <i>intelligent</i>.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.800
And we'll look at how compression works
so that we can take thousands of songs

01:39.800 --> 01:43.200
and fit them on a device that's
small enough to fit in your pocket.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.800
Computer Science is many things to many people,
and after working through this guide,

01:47.800 --> 01:52.400
you'll have a better idea of what Computer Science is,
and especially how we can use it

01:52.400 --> 01:57.000
to design software that will help people
in their everyday lives.

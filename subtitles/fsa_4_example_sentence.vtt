00:00.200 --> 00:08.200
Let’s get a fresh diagram, exactly the same as before.
How do we actually use it?

00:08.200 --> 00:11.400
Let’s say we get the sentence: “Moo.”

00:11.400 --> 00:16.400
We can already see that it starts with
a capital letter and ends with a full stop,

00:16.400 --> 00:20.600
but let’s run it through the automaton
to see what happens.

00:20.600 --> 00:26.200
Beginning from the start state (which is '1'),
we take each character in turn,

00:26.200 --> 00:29.000
following the transition for each one.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.200
The first character ‘M’ is uppercase,
so we follow the ‘U’ transition to State 3.

00:36.200 --> 00:43.200
Then we have a lowercase ‘o’, so we follow
the ‘L’ transition which loops around and back to State 3.

00:43.200 --> 00:49.200
Another lowercase ‘o’, so again we follow
the ‘L’ transition back to State 3.

00:49.200 --> 00:56.400
And lastly we have a full stop so we follow
the ‘S’ transition to State 4.

00:57.400 --> 01:02.200
So, we’ve gone through the string of letters
and ended up at State 4.

01:02.200 --> 01:08.200
Remember from before that this is an accepting state
because it has two circles.

01:08.200 --> 01:13.400
Since we ended up in an accepting state,
the sentence “Moo.” is accepted;

01:13.400 --> 01:20.000
it does indeed start with a capital letter
and end with a full stop.

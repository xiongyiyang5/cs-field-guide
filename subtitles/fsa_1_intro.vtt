00:00.200 --> 00:06.400
Let’s have a look at Finite State Automata
<00:03.900>or FSA for short.

00:06.400 --> 00:11.200
In this series of videos
we’re going to look at how FSA are useful,

00:11.200 --> 00:15.000
use them in an example
to test for valid sentences,

00:15.000 --> 00:20.400
and then build our own automata
to explore other uses.

00:20.400 --> 00:25.800
So, what do these words mean?
<i>Finite State Automata</i>

00:25.800 --> 00:28.600
Finite means that there are a limited number,

00:28.600 --> 00:33.400
as opposed to infinite,
which means the number is unlimited.

00:33.400 --> 00:41.400
A State is a condition at a particular time.
<00:37.000>And Automata is the plural for Automaton;

00:41.400 --> 00:47.600
a machine that functions on its own,
following some simple instructions and rules.

00:47.600 --> 00:54.600
Therefore, a Finite State Automaton
is a simple machine with a finite number of states.

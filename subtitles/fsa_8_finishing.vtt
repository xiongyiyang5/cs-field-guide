00:00.800 --> 00:08.800
The last thing we need to do is show
the ‘A’ transitions out of States 0, 1, and 2.

00:08.800 --> 00:14.200
Let’s take another step back from our automaton
and think about it logically.

00:14.200 --> 00:19.400
We have any number of ‘B’s in a row,
and then we get an ‘A’.

00:19.400 --> 00:25.800
That breaks our row of ‘B’s,
and we go back to having zero ‘B’s in a row.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.800
Now back to our automaton.

00:27.800 --> 00:33.200
We have zero, one or two ‘B’s in a row,
and then we get an ‘A’.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.400
We just decided that we go back
to the beginning, so let’s do it.

00:37.400 --> 00:46.000
Our ‘A’ transitions are from
0 to 0, 1 to 0, and 2 to 0.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.600
So, have we finished?
Let’s check.

00:50.600 --> 00:55.000
State 0 has an ‘A’ transition and a ‘B’ transition.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.600
State 1 has an ‘A’ transition and a ‘B’ transition.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.400
State 2 has an ‘A’ transition and a ‘B’ transition.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.800
And State 3 has an ‘A’ transition and a ‘B’ transition.

01:06.800 --> 01:14.000
We have our start state: ‘0’,
and we have our accepting states: ‘0’, ‘1’ and ‘2’.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.600
Awesome! All we have to do now is make sure it works.

01:18.600 --> 01:25.000
I’ll leave you to run through it with a few test cases.

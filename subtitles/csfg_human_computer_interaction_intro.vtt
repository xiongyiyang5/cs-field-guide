[Human Computer Interaction]
<00:00.800>Every device you use has an interface.

00:03.200 --> 00:08.000
Some interfaces are awesome,
and others range from mildly frustrating

00:08.000 --> 00:11.200
to throw-your-computer-off-a-building frustrating,

00:11.200 --> 00:15.800
I wanted to see what it would be like,
if some humans acted like some computers.

00:15.800 --> 00:20.000
Like when computers respond too slowly.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.600
[Info: Adding 5 items to your cart]

00:26.200 --> 00:27.800
<i>Would you like a lemonade?</i>

00:27.800 --> 00:29.800
Ah, yes please.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.200
Yes please.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.600
Yes.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.400
Yes I would like a lemonade.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.200
Yes!

00:38.200 --> 00:42.600
<i>Five lemonades coming up!</i>

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Have you ever tried setting the time on one of these?

00:55.200 --> 00:58.000
<i>How many napkins would you like?</i>
<00:57.000>Ah, four please.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
<i>One?</i>
No.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.100
<i>Two.</i>
No.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.200
<i>Three.</i>
No.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.200
<i>Four.</i>
No.<01:02.000> Wait yes!
<01:02.600><i>Five.</i>

01:03.200 --> 01:04.600
No.
<i>Six.</i>
No.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.600
<i>Seven.</i>
No.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.600
<i>Eight.</i>
No.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.600
<i>Nine.</i>
No.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.400
<i>Ten.</i>
No.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.600
<i>One.</i>
No.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.400
<i>Two.</i>
No.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.300
<i>Three.</i>
No.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.600
<i>Four.</i>
No. Wait!
<01:12.200><i>Five.</i>

01:12.600 --> 01:14.700
[sigh] No.
<i>Six.</i>

01:14.700 --> 01:18.200
Or when you're not expecting your phone to do this.
<01:17.200>Say cheese!

01:18.200 --> 01:20.000
["Cheese!"]

01:20.000 --> 01:23.400
Oh sorry I'm out of storage!
<01:22.000>["Awww"]

01:24.000 --> 01:26.800
Oh excuse me, can I please have a glass of water?

01:26.800 --> 01:32.000
<i>Sorry but my order pad is out of space.</i>
<01:30.000>Oh it's alright it's just there you could just grab it.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.200
<i>Sorry but my order pad is out of space.</i>

01:35.200 --> 01:41.600
Do you mind if I just get it?
<01:36.600><i>As I said before my order pad is out of space.</i>

01:43.000 --> 01:47.200
For anyone to use a digital device,
they have to use an interface.

01:47.200 --> 01:52.600
Having a good interface is critical
to the success of any software that you develop.

01:52.600 --> 01:57.200
It's not just about where you place things
on the screen, or what colours you use.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.600
It's about having an understanding
of both ends of the system.

02:00.600 --> 02:03.000
The device, and the human.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
The field of Human Computer Interaction, or HCI

02:07.000 --> 02:11.600
Is about understanding how people think,
and how they behave. And coming up with ways

02:11.600 --> 02:17.000
to help them avoid making mistakes
or getting frustrated with the digital device.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.000
<i>Would you like a lemonade?</i>
<02:20.600>[sigh]

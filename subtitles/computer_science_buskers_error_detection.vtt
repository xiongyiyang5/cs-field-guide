00:01.200 --> 00:04.000
Computer Science Buskers?

00:04.000 --> 00:08.800
Step right up ladies and gentlemen.
It is I, <i>Makita Yacov</i>, the world's greatest magician!

NOTE I can't understand what he said his first name is

00:08.800 --> 00:14.800
Come, let me boggle and astonish your mind,
I will leave you flunnexed like a raspberry on a fence!

NOTE Nor can I understand what he says at 'flunnexed'.
Also removed 'yeah?' at the end of the above line to avoid having
to separate the subtitles.

00:14.800 --> 00:21.400
You sir, yes you in the striped top, you look
like urban tiger, come, let me show you something.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.200
<i>Are you really as good as you say you are?</i>

00:23.200 --> 00:27.200
But of course I am! Would you expect any less
from a man who has cape and hat?

00:27.200 --> 00:29.000
<i>I suppose not. So what can you do?</i>

00:29.000 --> 00:33.200
Well, observe, I have here
a pack of multicoloured cards.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.300
<i>They're not multicoloured they're just...</i>
<00:34.400>Silence, fool!

00:36.300 --> 00:40.400
Now, your task is to set these into a six by six square.
[Laughter]

00:40.400 --> 00:45.400
<i>Okay</i>
Do it, do it perfectly.

00:45.400 --> 00:55.400
Hurry boy hurry, I have not all day to prepare trick.
Come faster faster, move your digits.

00:55.400 --> 01:04.600
No! this is too easy,
allow me to add another row and column.

01:13.400 --> 01:18.600
Good! Now, while I face the opposite direction,
you take one of these cards and flip it over.

01:18.600 --> 01:22.800
Then, I turn around and reveal which card you flipped.

01:22.800 --> 01:26.000
<i>All right turn around then.</i>

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
<i>Done.</i>

01:36.200 --> 01:38.800
This is your card!

01:38.800 --> 01:40.000
<i>That was terrific!</i>

01:40.000 --> 01:42.800
I know, because I am great!

01:42.800 --> 01:46.000
<i>Incredible.</i>

01:57.600 --> 02:00.200
<i>So, how exactly did you do that?</i>

02:00.200 --> 02:06.400
Excuse me? You think a magician as talented as I,
am going to give you my secrets.

02:06.400 --> 02:12.400
<i>Ahh, come on I promise I won't tell anyone.</i>

02:17.800 --> 02:20.000
Yeah
<i>Wow</i>

02:20.000 --> 02:21.400
<i>That's very interesting.</i>

02:21.400 --> 02:27.600
Yes, it is. But show or tell noone,
or there will be trouble!

02:27.600 --> 02:35.000
Do not mess with the great Makita Yacov!
<02:30.200>[Laughter]

02:39.200 --> 02:46.400
Step right up step right up, I'm, uhh Trevor!
The greatest magician in all the world!

02:46.400 --> 02:52.200
Allow me to amaze you with my magic tricks!
You won't believe your eyes.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.600
They're so...<2:54.400> Magic!

02:55.600 --> 02:56.600
<i>Magic Trick eh?</i>

02:56.600 --> 03:02.400
Yes! What I need you to do for me is
lay out these squares in six rows of six.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.200
<i>Sure</i>

03:03.200 --> 03:08.600
Faster now, I don't have all day, I am a magician
and I have other people to do magic for.

03:08.600 --> 03:14.100
Quick, quicker, quicker. All right that's good,
and let me add another row just to make it

03:14.100 --> 03:18.000
a wee bit more difficult.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.400
Now, when I turn around, you will flip
one of the cards over.

03:22.400 --> 03:28.000
I'm turning around, and when I turn back,
I will tell you which card you FLIPPED.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.200
Oh. Ohh.

03:30.200 --> 03:36.000
What do you call this! I thought I told you
never to repeat my glorifying magic to anyone!

03:36.000 --> 03:42.400
Uhhh, I was teaching him how to play chess!
Yeah, chess.

03:42.400 --> 03:47.800
No what I meant to say was I was showing him
how computers store data using binary digits.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.800
Zeros and ones.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.000
See this square, it represents what is called a bit.

03:53.000 --> 03:53.800
<i>A bit?</i>

03:53.800 --> 03:59.400
Yeah, a bit, which is short for Binary Digit.
And sometimes these binary digits get flipped,

03:59.400 --> 04:04.800
and then the computer has to realise there's an error
and work out which bit it needs to fix.

04:04.800 --> 04:16.000
I am furious, like pidgeon eating cricket bat!
I told you, never to mess with the great Makita Yacov!

04:20.000 --> 04:23.400
[Clapping]

04:27.400 --> 04:36.200
[Laughs] Now my collection is a little <b>bit</b> bigger.
<04:32.600>[Laughter]

04:38.000 --> 04:45.200
The secret of my trick is revealed at csunplugged.org
where it's called Error Detection.

04:45.200 --> 04:51.000
But don't go showing anyone, for if you do,
you too may be joining my fabulous team of bits.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
[Laughter]

00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
Let’s take a look at how we use
the four basic symbols in a Regular Expression,

00:05.800 --> 00:08.500
starting with the parentheses.

00:08.500 --> 00:17.400
In arithmetic, if we have the equation 1 + 2 x 3,
we follow the order of arithmetic expressions

00:17.400 --> 00:24.200
and solve the multiplication first.
So we get 1 + 6 which equals 7,

00:24.200 --> 00:32.600
but if we add parentheses around 1 + 2,
it holds the highest precedence and so we get 3 x 3,

00:32.600 --> 00:41.400
which equals 9. In regex, parentheses work
in the same way, specifying the highest precedence.

00:41.400 --> 00:49.000
Next we have the Kleene star, named after the man
who helped found the concept of Regular Expressions.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
This matches the preceding symbol
repeated zero or more times.

00:54.000 --> 01:04.600
For example, BA* will match
B and BA and BAA and BAAA and so on.

01:04.600 --> 01:10.200
Lastly we have the alternation symbol.
This can be read as a choice,

01:10.200 --> 01:19.800
so the expression A(A|B)
matches both AA and AB.

01:19.800 --> 01:29.600
We usually refer to this as ‘bar’ and read it as ‘or.’
<01:25.400>Bar has the lowest precedence of the basic regex symbols,

01:29.600 --> 01:42.200
so A|B* is the same as saying A|(B*),
which means you can either match an A, or any number of Bs.

00:00.200 --> 00:05.800
Let’s look at another sentence: “URL.com”

00:05.800 --> 00:13.000
Starting again from the start state we take
the uppercase letter ‘U’ transition to State 3,

00:13.000 --> 00:16.800
then an uppercase ‘R’ transition to State 3,

00:16.800 --> 00:21.000
another uppercase ‘L’ transition to State 3,

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
a full stop transition to State 4,

00:24.000 --> 00:28.200
a lowercase ‘c’ transition back to State 3,

00:28.200 --> 00:32.000
another lowercase ‘o’ transition to State 3,

00:32.000 --> 00:37.600
and lastly the lowercase ‘m’ transition to State 3.

00:37.600 --> 00:44.400
This time we are not at an accepting state,
so even though we passed through the accepting state,

00:44.400 --> 00:50.200
the automaton does not accept
“URL.com” as a valid sentence.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.400
However, with the addition of one more full stop,

00:53.400 --> 00:58.200
we can make this into a sentence
accepted by the automaton.

01:00.900 --> 01:07.800
In a more general sense, there are three
extra words we often use in Finite State Automata.

01:07.800 --> 01:11.800
The first is called the <i>alphabet</i> of our automaton.

01:11.800 --> 01:16.800
This is just a list of
all possible inputs that result in a transition.

01:16.800 --> 01:22.200
In our example, our alphabet is ‘U’, ‘S’, and ‘L’.

01:22.200 --> 01:27.400
The sentences we use to test
this automaton are known as <i>strings</i>,

01:27.400 --> 01:37.400
which are sequences of inputs from our alphabet.
“Moo.” and “URL.com” are examples of this.

01:37.400 --> 01:45.800
Lastly, we have a <i>language</i>. This is all the
possible strings that are accepted by our automaton.

01:45.800 --> 01:53.000
“Moo.” is one of the many strings in this language,
but although “URL.com” is a string,

01:53.000 --> 01:59.800
it is not in our language,
because it was not accepted by our automaton.

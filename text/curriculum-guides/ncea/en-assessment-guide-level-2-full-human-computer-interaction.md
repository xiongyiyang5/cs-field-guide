# Excellence Guide for Human Computer Interaction (2.44)

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="Disclaimer"}
This guide is not official, but is based information gained from a lot of experience with the standard, so reflects our best understanding of what is expected.
{panel end}

This is a guide for students attempting Human Computer Interaction in digital technologies achievement standard 2.44 (AS91371).

In order to fully cover the standard, you will also need to have done projects covering the topics of Representing Data and Encoding, and included these in your report.


## Overview

Human Computer Interaction has the following bullet points in achievement standard 2.44, which this guide covers.

**Achieved**: "providing examples from human-computer interfaces that illustrate usability heuristics"

**Merit**: "evaluating a given human-computer interface in terms of usability heuristics"

**Excellence**: "suggesting improvements to a given human-computer interface based on an
evaluation in terms of usability heuristics"

As with all externally assessed reports, you should base your explanations around personalised examples, so that the marker can be confident that your report is your own work.

## Reading from the Computer Science Field Guide

Start by reading these introduction sections. They will give you a general overview of what Human Computer Interaction is all about. If you read them last year for 1.44 and remember the material well, you can just quickly skim over them.

[Users and Tasks](human-computer-interaction.html#users-and-tasks)

[Interface Usability](human-computer-interaction.html#interface-usability)

Then read the section on usability heuristics. You will need to understand this material well.

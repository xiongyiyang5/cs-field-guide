# Artificial Intelligence (3.44) - Chat Bots

{comment}
The material below is just extracted from the chapters at present, and will need updating to refer back to them.
{comment end}



In this project, you will write a report about your investigations of Chatterbots and the Turing Test.

The report consists of 2 parts. The first involves demonstrating that you understand the Turing Test by carrying out your own Turing Test and then answering some questions about the Turing Test. The second part involves having conversations with several chatterbots and investigating some common techniques they used in order to sound as though they have human intelligence.

If you haven’t already, carry out the Turing Test in the project in the above section. Once you have carried out the Turing Test and have your two conversations, answer the following questions in your report, to show you understand the Turing Test. *Make sure you include the two conversations in your report!*

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxx"}

A1 - The Turing Test attempts to address a key problem in AI; students should show they understand this problem. [this note and the following ones give the match between the student task and the requirements of the 3.44 standard. A1 means bullet point 1 of the achieved requirements]
{panel end}


Explain what the Turing Test is for, using your experience with chatterbots as an example.

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxx"}

A2 - Students should describe an example of applying the Turing Test.
{panel end}


Describe what you did to run a Turing Test, including a copy of the two conversations.

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxx"}

M1 - Students should describe the factors to be careful of when carrying out the Turing Test to show understanding of how the Turing Test works.
{panel end}


When you were carrying out the Turing Test, you had to be careful to avoid external factors that gave away which was the computer and which was the human.  Explain some of these factors and why it is important to avoid them. (Some of them were mentioned in the text above!)

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxx"}

M2 E1- Students should discuss applications of the Turing test.
{panel end}


Explain how the Turing Test could be used to evaluate a new chatbot. Discuss other possible applications of the Turing Test or similar tests for other programs that are supposed to be intelligent.  

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxx"}

E2 - Students should evaluate the effectiveness of the Turing test, discussing whether or not it is a good measure of intelligence, and the limitations of it.
{panel end}


Discuss whether or not the Turing test is a good test of intelligence, giving reasons for your answer and using examples from your chatterbot experiments. What parts of *human* intelligence would the Turing test not capture?

Before completing this second part of your report, you should ensure you have talked to at least three chatterbots (either the ones talked about in this book or other ones you find).

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxx"}

A1 - Students should describe the key problem(s) that chatterbots are addressing
{panel end}


What is it that chatterbots are trying to accomplish?

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxx"}

A2 - Students should describe various chatterbots, and show examples of conversations with the chatterbots.
{panel end}


Describe the chatterbots that you have investigated. Show a brief conversation with each of them to illustrate what they do (no more than 10 lines for each conversation).

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxx"}

A2, M1, M2, E1, E2 - This exercise combines several of the requirements. Students have to describe/ explain/ discuss conversations with chatterbots to show they understand the different techniques that chatterbots use to sound like they have human intelligence (A2/M2/E1/E2), along with explaining how the technique actually works to show they understand the technique itself (M1)
{panel end}


Choose at least two techniques used by chatterbots in an attempt to sound like they have human intelligence. The techniques you choose could be the identification of key words, canned responses, learning from humans, giving very general replies, or anything else you notice about how a chatterbot tends to speak or react that is an attempt to make it sound human (including techniques that make sense in some cases that the chatterbot uses them, but not in others!)

For each of the techniques you choose, do the following:
- Explain how the technique works, using specific examples.
- Give examples of specific chatterbots that use this technique, and examples of conversations with these chatterbots where it is obvious that they are using these techniques.
- Explain your examples in terms of the technique(s) they are illustrating.
- Discuss how well the techniques work and when they break.

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxx"}

E2 Students need to evaluate the chatterbots and the techniques they use.
{panel end}


Which techniques seemed to be the most effective, if any? How could you tell that these chatterbots weren’t actually human? What were the main limitations of the chatterbots? Which chatterbot out of the ones you talked to do you think was the most intelligent? Which was the least intelligent? Why?

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxx"}

E1 This further builds on E1, getting students to discuss further practical applications on chatterbots, beyond the web entertainment ones they have looked at.
{panel end}


Most of the chatterbots you have looked at here exist solely for the purpose of web entertainment, or as attempts to pass the Turing Test. These however aren’t the only applications of chatterbots. Discuss how chatterbots be useful in other applications, for example, help systems and games? Can you think of any other possible applications for chatterbots?

As further guidance as to what students should do, we have made this overall outline of how the project fits the standard. Note that this covers one of the two areas of computer science students have to cover in their report. They must pick one other area of computer science to do a project on as well.

- **Selected Area**: Artificial Intelligence
- **Key Problems**: Determining whether or not a computer program is intelligent, designing computer programs that have human intelligence
- **Key algorithm/Techniques**: The Turing Test, various chatterbot design techniques
- **Examples of practical applications**: various Chatterbots, carrying out the Turing Test.
- **Personalised student examples**: each student conversation should be unique

**For achieved, it could be expected that a student...**

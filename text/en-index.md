The title for the homepage is ignored and substituted with a header (with subititle) from the HTML templates, and defaults to the 'Computer Science Field Guide' title.

A teacher's guide is available (currently aimed primarily for New Zealand teachers teaching NCEA). Read the [About section](about.html) for more details to access this.

This guide features interactive activities within some of the chapters. These should work with any modern browser updated in the last year, but we are continually expanding the compatibility of these. This guide is open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/uccser/cs-field-guide).

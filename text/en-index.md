# Welcome!

The Computer Science Field Guide is an online interactive resource for high school students learning about computer science, developed at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.

A teacher's guide is available (currently aimed primarily for New Zealand teachers teaching NCEA). Read the [About section](about.html) for more details to access this.

This guide features interactive activities within some of the chapters. These should work with any modern browser updated in the last year, but we are continually expanding the compatibility of these. This guide is open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/uccser/cs-field-guide).

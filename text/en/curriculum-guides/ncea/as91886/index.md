## Demonstrate understanding of human computer interaction

Human computer interaction is about evaluating and designing interfaces on digital devices.
It involves a considerable element of psychology, as it is about how humans perceive and interface.
A common misunderstanding is that this standard might be about building an interface; it is much easier to do this assessment based on an existing interface, as the worst person to evaluate an interface is the person who designed it.
The challenge for many students is to step back from the device and think about what challenges and confusion it might cause for the user, which requires a good level of sympathy for a "typical" user!

This topic is covered in detail in the [Human Computer Interaction chapter](chapters/human-computer-interaction.html).

The first section of the chapter introduces the [big ideas around HCI](chapters/human-computer-interaction.html#whats-the-big-picture), and the second section sensitises students to the issues around [users and tasks](chapters/human-computer-interaction.html#users-and-tasks).
Some general issues and approaches are raised in the [interface usability section](chapters/human-computer-interaction.html#interface-usability), and then the idea of [usablity heuristics](chapters/human-computer-interaction.html#usability-heuristics) is introduced.
These are the key to addressing the standard, but the preliminary understanding is needed to avoid just treating them in isolation.

Where the standard calls for Heuristics to be used, you should use the 10 listed in [usability heuristics section](chapters/human-computer-interaction.html#usability-heuristics), which were originally published by Jakob Nielsen.
(Other sets of heuristics exist, but these ones are widely used and fairly straight-forward to apply.)

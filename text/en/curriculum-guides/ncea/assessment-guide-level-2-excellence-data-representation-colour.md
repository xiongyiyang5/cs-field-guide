# Excellence Guide for Data Representation (2.44) - Colours

This is an excellence level guide for students attempting data representation in digital technologies achievement standard 2.44 (AS91371). It is aimed at students going for merit or excellence.

You will need to do one more project in data representation in addition to this one, because the standard requires you to cover two. This guide only covers text. Note that there is no excellence requirements for data representation -- it only goes up to merit. This guide is called an excellence guide though to avoid confusion about whether or not it is suitable for students aiming for excellence.

In order to fully cover the standard, you will also need to have done one more project on data representation, projects covering the three encoding topics up to the achieved level (error control coding, encryption, and compression), and a project covering human computer interaction, and included these in your report.

## Overview

The topic of Data Representation has the following bullet points in achievement standard 2.44, which this guide covers.

**Achieved**: "describing ways in which different types of data can be represented using bits"
**Merit**: "comparing and contrasting different ways in which different types of data can be
represented using bits and discussing the implications"

This guide focusses on one of the types of data you will need to cover (you will need to cover 2).

As with all externally assessed reports, you should base your explanations around personalised examples.

### Writing an Introduction to Data Representation

***You only need to do this if you have not already done it (the other guide you follow for data representation will also tell you to write this intro)***

This section will be around ¼ to ½ of a page.

Start the data representation section of your report by writing an introduction to the topic of data representation. Describe what a "bit" is, and why computers use bits to represent data. Briefly describe a couple of the ways in which computers physically represent bits (if you open a computer, you will ***not*** see lots of little 0's and 1's!).

This explanation must be in your own words, based on what you understood in class (e.g. do not paraphrase a definition)

***This is the main part of your project.***

This section will be around 1 to 1½ pages in your report. There are 5 parts to it.

1. Choosing a colour that you like, explaining how it is represented with values of red, green, and blue, and explaining why computers represent colours in this way.
2. Explaining what is meant by "colour depth", "24 bit colour", "16 bit colour", and "8 bit colour".
3. Converting your chosen colour to its 24 bit binary representation, explaining the process clearly.
4. Showing how your colour would be represented with 8 bits, and explaining whether or not the colour is still the same as it was with 24 bits, and why.
5. Discussing why we commonly use 24 bit colour as opposed to 8 bit colour or 16 bit colour, but not a higher number of bits, such as 32 bits or more.

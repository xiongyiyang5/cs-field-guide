# Representing Data using Bits (Text) (2.44)

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="Disclaimer"}
This guide is not official, but is based information gained from a lot of experience with the standard, so reflects our best understanding of what is expected.
{panel end}

This is a guide for students attempting Data Representation in digital technologies achievement standard 2.44 (AS91371). You will need to cover two different types of data to meet the requirements of the standard (each assessment guide only covers one). See the introduction for the 2.44 guides for more details on choosing topics; this guide covers the "characters/text" type of data.

In order to fully cover the standard, you will also need to have done one more project for representing data using bits and projects covering the topics of Encoding and Human Computer Interaction, and included these in your report.

## Overview

Data Representation has the following bullet points in achievement standard 2.44, which this guide covers. Note that the topic of Data Representation does *not* have excellence criteria.

**Achieved**: "describing ways in which different types of data can be represented using bits"

**Merit**: "comparing and contrasting different ways in which different types of data can be represented using bits and discussing the implications"

As with all externally assessed reports, you should base your explanations around personalised examples, so that the marker can be confident that your report is your own work.

## Reading from the Computer Science Field Guide

You should read and work through the interactives in the following sections of the CS Field Guide in order to prepare yourself for the assessed project.

Read all of these sections, as they give the necessary introduction of the topic

[Whatâ€™s the Big Picture? (General information about bits)](chapters/data-representation.html#whats-the-big-picture)

Also read the section on text representation, for ASCII and Unicode. This guide will be updated with the link once the chapter has been updated (it is currently undergoing a major refactoring!)

# Achieved Guide for Data Representation (2.44) - Numbers and Text

This is an achieved level guide for students attempting data representation in digital technologies achievement standard 2.44 (AS91371). It is only suitable for students who aren't aiming to get more than achieved.

Note that this is the *only* guide you need to follow to satisfy the data representation requirements up to achieved. It covers two different data types - numbers and text.

In order to fully cover the standard, you will also need to have done projects covering the three encoding topics up to the achieved level (error control coding, encryption, and compression), and a project covering human computer interaction, and include these in your report.

## Overview

The topic of Data Representation has the following achieved bullet point in achievement standard 2.44, which this guide covers.

**Achieved**: “describing ways in which different types of data can be represented using bits”

As with all externally assessed reports, you should base your explanations around personalised examples.

## Reading from the Computer Science Field Guide

You should read and work through the interactives in the following sections of the CS Field Guide in order to prepare yourself for the assessed project.

Read all of these sections, as they give the necessary introduction of the topic

[What’s the Big Picture?](chapters/data-representation.html#whats-the-big-picture)

[Representing numbers with bits](chapters/data-representation.html#numbers)

[Representing text with bits](chapters/data-representation.html#text)

## Project

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="This activity should not take long"}
Despite being one of the three bullet points, this component of the standard should take less than a third of the total time, and take up only a small amount of space in the student's report. Infact, it should only be around 1 page long, with most of the space being the examples (rather than text). All the student needs to do is briefly introduce what bits are and about how they are used to represent data in computers, and then show some examples of binary numbers and ASCII, both of which are very straightforward.
{panel end}

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="Keep the intro short. There is no reason to paraphrase material"}
The only purpose of this first part is to provide an introduction to the section (as a good report uses introductions to sections) and to show the marker that they know how this overall topic links back to computers.

If the student cannot explain what a "bit" or "data representation" means in their own words without paraphrasing, they're demonstrating that they have a very poor understanding of the topic.
{panel end}

Start this section by writing an introduction to the topic of data representation. Describe what a "bit" is, and why computers use bits to represent data. This introduction only needs to be a couple of sentences - you are just showing the marker that you understand what a "bit" is, and how "bits" are used to represent data. It must be in your own words, based on what you understood in class (e.g. do not paraphrase a definition).

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="A possible way of presenting the binary number examples"}
In Computer Science Unplugged, binary numbers are taught using cards with dots on them. Check out the [activity](http://csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-01-binary_numbers.pdf) if you are not familiar with this.

What students could do in their report is to draw cards with dots (or take photos of actual cards) to show how the binary number is determined, convert it to 1's and 0's, and then describe how they knew which cards needed to be showing, and how they know their representation is correct (i.e. the number of dots adds up to the number they are trying to make). Note that the binary cards can be drawn very small, yet still be legible.
{panel end}

Next, you are going to show an example of how the day and month (number form) of your birthday are represented in binary. If you don't want to include your real birthday in your report, you can make one up, but it must not be the same birthday that somebody else in your class is using. For each of the two numbers, show the working you use to get the binary representation, the final binary representation using 1's and 0's, and a description of what you did to get the binary representation.

Finally you are going to show one other type of representation - the ASCII representation, which is used to represent strings of text. You will do this by showing your first name and favorite food in ASCII. Find an ASCII table (there is one in the field guide). Now, use the table to convert both the words to ASCII. Briefly describe how you used the ASCII table to convert these words to ASCII. You should *not* include the ASCII table in your report.

## Hints for success

- Put a main heading for Data Representation (your report will also have main headings for Encoding and Human Computer Interaction) and subheadings for Representing Numbers and Representing Text. Be careful to put your explanations and examples under the correct headings.
- Do not include large lists or tables, for example do not include an ASCII table or a list of binary number conversions.
- This project should not take up more than 1 to 1½ pages in your report.

Removed from chapter in section on negative numbers:
{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxxx"}
Students can do this for merit, and they should also discuss why they choose the integer types they did.

Removed from section on numbers in programming Languages

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="xxxxxx"}

This section is an alternative approach to doing a project with number representation which is appropriate if the students are using a text-based programming language that supports different types of integers. It involves writing programs that cause errors by overflowing the numbers, which can force them to work with quite large values!

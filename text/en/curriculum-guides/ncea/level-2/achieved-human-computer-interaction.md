# Achieved only Guide for Human Computer Interaction (2.44)

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="Disclaimer"}
This guide is not official, but is based information gained from a lot of experience with the standard, so reflects our best understanding of what is expected.
{panel end}

This is a guide for students attempting Human Computer Interaction in digital technologies achievement standard 2.44 (AS91371), who are aiming for **Achieved**.

In order to fully cover the standard, you will also need to have done projects covering the topics of Representing Data and Encoding, and included these in your report.

## Overview

Human Computer Interaction has the following achieved bullet points in achievement standard 2.44, which this guide covers.

**Achieved**: "providing examples from human-computer interfaces that illustrate usability heuristics"

As with all externally assessed reports, you should base your explanations around personalised examples, so that the marker can be confident that your report is your own work.

## Reading from the Computer Science Field Guide

Start by reading these introduction sections. They will give you a general overview of what Human Computer Interaction is all about. If you read them last year for 1.44 and remember the material well, you can just quickly skim over them.

- [What’s the Big Picture?](chapters/human-computer-interaction.html#whats-the-big-picture)
- [Usability Heuristics](chapters/human-computer-interaction.html#usability-heuristics)

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="Should students read the other sections as well?"}
It is ideal for students to read/ be taught the entire chapter. However, we realise that learning large amounts of information is not desirable for students who only want achieved. Therefore, we have recommended only the sections that are essential.

Keep in mind also that the heuristics should be taught in class, in addition to encouraging students to read about them in the field guide.

## Project

{panel type="teacher-note" summary="The examples must be the student's own"}
While it may be tempting for students to recite examples that were discussed in class or that they found on the Internet, this is not sufficient for achieved.

In order to demonstrate *understanding* of usability heuristics, the student should be able to identify which heuristic was violated for a given usability issue identified.

It is probably worth getting students (particularly the weaker students) to think of suitable examples *before* they start writing their introduction. Get them to fill in a table with three situations they have personally experienced where they had difficulty using a computer system. Next to each situation, they should write which heuristic(s) they think was violated. Once they have completed the table, they can convert it into words for their report.

It might also be worth getting students to write their intro under exam like conditions (quiet, no internet).

### Achieved

Everybody has experienced times where a computer system does not do what they expect and/ or they cannot get it to do what they want. A natural reaction to this for many people is to blame themselves. However, in almost every case, the real problem is with the design of the interface. In the field guide or in class, you will have learnt a lot about Nielson's Heuristics. If you think back on some of the times where you've had difficulty with a computer system, you'll probably be able to identify which of Nielson's Heuristics were violated.

In order to demonstrate understanding of Usability Heuristics, you should write a brief (around half to 1 pages) introduction to Nielson's heuristics, using a couple of examples (preferably two good ones, but no more than three) you have come across in your day to day life to illustrate your introduction.

Your introduction should do the following:
- Summarise the purpose of Nielson's heuristics. i.e. why do computer scientists find the heuristics useful to know?
- Include two or three examples of heuristics violations you've come across in your every day life. For each of these examples you should:
  - Explain what and when it happened (one or two sentences should be enough).
  - State which heuristic(s) was/were violated (give the full name of the heuristic - just it's number is not enough). Remember that there is not necessarily one right answer. Different people will come to different conclusions.
  - Explain **why** you think it was that/those particular heuristic(s) violated (one sentence should be enough). There isn't any one right answer, just write what you think.

You should **not**:
- List all the heuristics (it's not necessary and wastes space/ bulks out the report unnecessarily)
- List examples you were given in class or read about on the Internet (the marker is only interested in the heuristic violations **you** identify and classify).

### Merit/ Excellence

Because this is an **achieved only** guide, you should follow the merit/ excellence guide for HCI instead if you are aiming for higher than achieved.

## Hints for Success
- Do not include a list of the heuristics. It is not necessary.
- Do not write about the cliché examples you have found on the Internet. Remember that the point of the standard is that *you* can identify the heuristic that was violated, given an identified usability issue.
- Only use images if they are helpful. *Ensure they are legible.*

## Recommended Number of Pages

We recommend not writing more than 1 page for this topic for achieved. 2 pages might be reasonable if you want to include a lot of images, although should not be viewed as a target.

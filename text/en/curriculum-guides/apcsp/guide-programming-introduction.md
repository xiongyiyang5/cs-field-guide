## Reading from the Computer Science Field Guide
Start by reading through:

- [Programming Languages](chapters/programming-languages.html)
- [Software Engineering](chapters/software-engineering.html)
- [Human Computer Interaction](chapters/human-computer-interaction.html)

The AP CSP framework does not require a specific programming language but require students to learn programming. Choose one or more of the options from:

- [Programming Introduction](chapters/introduction.html#programming)

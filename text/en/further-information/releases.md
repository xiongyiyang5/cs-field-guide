# Releases

This page lists the different releases to the Computer Science Field Guide.

{panel type="What numbering system do we use?"}

We base our numbering system from the guidelines at [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), however since our project started before it was migrated to GitHub, the first open source release is being labelled as 2.0.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:

- MAJOR version change when major text modifications are made (for example: new chapter, changing how a curriculum guide teaches a subject)
- MINOR version change when new content or new functionality is added (for example: new videos, new activities)
- PATCH version change when bug fixes are made (for example: fixing typos, errors in interactives)
- A pre-release version is denoted by appending a hyphen and the alpha label followed by the patch version.

**Comments:**
The first major step in releasing a open source version of the Computer Science Field Guide.
While some content (most notably interactives) have yet to be added to the new system, we are releasing this update for teachers to use at the beginning of their academic year.
For any interactives that are missing, links are in place to the older interactives.

# Releases

This page lists updates to the Computer Science Field Guide. All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

{panel type="What numbering system do we use?"}

We base our numbering system from the guidelines at [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), however since our project started before it was migrated to GitHub, the first open source release is being labeled as `v2.0.0`.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.HOTFIX:

- MAJOR version change when major text modifications are made (for example: new chapter, changing how a curriculum guide teaches a subject).
- MINOR version change when content or functionality is added or updated (for example: new videos, new activities, large number of text (typo/grammar) fixes).
- HOTFIX version change when bug hotfixes are made (for example: fixing a typo, fixing a bug in an interactive).
- A pre-release version is denoted by appending a hyphen and the alpha label followed by the pre-release version.

{panel end}

We have listed major changes for each release below.

### v2.5.0

**Release date:** 13th May 2016

**Downloads:** [Source available on GitHub](https://github.com/uccser/cs-field-guide/releases/tag/v2.5.0)

**Notable changes:**
- The Data Representation chapter has been rewritten and reorganised to be easier to follow, and three NCEA assessment guides have been written for students aiming for merit/excellence:
  - [Numbers (Two's Complement)](curriculum-guides/ncea/assessment-guide-level-2-excellence-data-representation-numbers.html)
  - [Text (Unicode)](curriculum-guides/ncea/assessment-guide-level-2-excellence-data-representation-text.html)
  - [Colours (Various bit depths)](curriculum-guides/ncea/assessment-guide-level-2-excellence-data-representation-colour.html)

  The chapter and assessment guides have been rewritten to take account of new feedback from the marking process and our own observations of student work.

  As part of the rewrite of the Data Representation chapter, the following interactives were developed:
  - New interactive: The [unicode binary interactive](interactives/unicode-binary/index.html) displays the binary for a given character (or character by decimal number) dynamically with different encodings.
  - New interactive: The [unicode character interactive](interactives/unicode-chars/index.html) displays the character for a given decimal value.
  - New interactive: The [unicode length interactive](interactives/unicode-length/index.html) displays the length (in bits) of text encoded using different encodings.
  - Updated interactive: The [colour matcher interactive](interactives/colour-matcher/index.html) has been redesigned to display values in binary, plus allow students to see and edit the bit values. The interface has also been restructured for readability and ease of use.

  The old version of the Data Representation chapter can be [found here](http://csfieldguide.org.nz/releases/2.4.1/en/chapters/data-representation.html).
- Website improvements: A new image previewer was implemented, along with bugfixes to iFrame and panel rendering.
- Generation improvements: The Markdown parser has been replaced due to existing parsing issues. The new parser also gives us a large performance boost. A text box tag has also been added to highlight important text.

# Interactives

We have plenty of interactives throughout the CSFG, to teach many different computer science concepts.

## Troubleshooting

Most of our interactives require a modern browser, if it's been updated in the last year you should be fine. We recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/). While most interactives work on both phones, tablets, and desktop computers, some of our more complex interactives require a desktop computer to achieve performance.

# Text Folder

This folder stores all the text used to create the Computer Science Field Guide.
Each language is stored in a separate folder using the language code ([a list of language codes is available here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)).
The source folder directory structure will be the same for website output, with Markdown files converted to HTML files.

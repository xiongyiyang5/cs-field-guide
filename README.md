# Computer Science Field Guide

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uccser/cs-field-guide.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uccser/cs-field-guide)

The Computer Science Field Guide (CSFG) is an online interactive resource for high school students learning about computer science, developed at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.
The latest HTML release of the Computer Science Field Guide can be viewed at [www.csfieldguide.org.nz](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/).
This repository aims to be the source for all data associated with the CSFG, and also allows users to suggest improvements or create their own version.

## Project Philosophy

The CSFG aims to be an document used for teaching Computer Science all over the world in many different languages.
After using an internal system for creating the guide (from 2012 to 2015), we have moved to a custom open source system.
All areas of the project, from chapter text to website design, are now available for all.
We want this project to be as accessible as possible to our many user groups, which includes students, teachers and educators, and developers.

## Documentation

Documentation for this project can be found on
[ReadTheDocs](http://cs-field-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),

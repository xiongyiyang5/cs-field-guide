# Computer Science Field Guide

The Computer Science Field Guide (CSFG) is an online interactive resource for high school students learning about computer science, developed at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. The latest HTML release of the Computer Science Field Guide can be viewed at [www.csfieldguide.org.nz](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/). This repository aims to be the source for all data associated with the CSFG, and also allows users to suggest improvements or create their own version.

## Project Philosophy

The CSFG aims to be an document used for teaching Computer Science all over the world in many different languages. After using an internal system for creating the guide (from 2012 to 2015), we have moved to a custom build and open source system. All areas of the project, from chapter text to website design, are now available for all.

We want this project to be as accessible as possible to our many user groups, which includes students, teachers and educators, and developers. We aim to simplify the experience of creating your guide by requiring no external dependencies (other than Python 3) for websites, and easy guides and tools for contributing text changes.

## What's included

Within this repository, you will find the following folders:

- **text:** All text files for chapters, curriculum guides, and extra pages, in English and other languages.
- **images:** All images used within the guide, except those used in interactives.
- **interactives:** All data associated with interactives.
- **files:** Files that are downloaded from the text (for example: PDFs, spreadsheets, code examples).
- **generator:** Data used to create the output of the guide.
- **output:** Contains the output files of the generator, when run by the user.
- **docs:** Contains the documentation about this repository.

## Installation and Usage

Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/uccser/cs-field-guide/releases). Run `generateguide.py` with Python 3 (which from the command line is `python generateguide.py`).

### Optional Parameters

The following parameters may be used to alter the generation process:
- `--ignore-pip`: Bypasses the installation of dependencies using pip.
- `--pdf`: Include generation of pdf version of the field guide.

## Bugs and feature requests

## Documentation

Complete documentation for this project is stored in the [docs folder](docs/README.md).

## Contributing

We are currently still constructing this repository to produce a complete guide so will not be accepting any pull requests until v2.0 is released (v1.0 is a closed source system, the first major release on GitHub will be v2.0). After this point we would love the community to get involved into making this guide as great as possible!
A guide on how to contribute to the project (from correcting a spelling mistake to adding a translation) will be written as part of the documentation for the v2.0 release. Possible areas users will be able to contribute include:

- Suggesting a text edit for a typo, grammar correction, or just clearing up a point.
- Add a translation for a chapter or interactive.
- Add a new or replacement image for a chapter.
- Modify text and create their own version of the CSFG.
- Add or modify an interactive for the guide.

We use [Vincent Driessen's Git Branching Model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for managing development.

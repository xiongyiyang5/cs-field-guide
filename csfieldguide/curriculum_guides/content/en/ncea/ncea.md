# NCEA Assessment Guides

These assessment guides have been written to assist teachers and students
for the following NCEA Achievement Standards.

{panel type="caution" expanded="true"}

# These guides may be out of date.

We recommend reading the guidance on this page very carefully to ensure students are working on the right material.
There is also a lot of material available online from NZQA, and good ideas shared on the [DTTA](http://nzacditt.org.nz/) mailing list.

The standards below were trialled in 2017, and are available from 2018. They replace AS91074 (1.44), which is available up to 2018.
The form of assessment for the external standards is still being clarified, so the guide relates to the standards rather than the details of how the assessment is done.
At present NZQA is proposing a Common Assessment Task (CAT), which would guide students through how they should demonstrate their understanding of the concepts in the standard.

[AS91885 Digital Technology 1.9: Demonstrate understanding of searching and sorting algorithms]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'as91885')

[AS91886 Digital Technology 1.10: Demonstrate understanding of human computer interaction]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'as91886')

[AS91887 Digital Technology 1.11: Demonstrate understanding of compression coding for a chosen media type]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'as91887')

The following assessments are being phased out over the next few years, be sure to check the expiry date of these achievement standards.

[AS91074 Digital Technology 1.44: Demonstrate understanding of basic concepts in computer science]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'as91074')

[AS91371 Digital Technology 2.44: Demonstrate understanding of advanced concepts in computer science]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'as91371')

[AS91636 Digital Technology 3.44: Demonstrate understanding og areas of computer science]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'as91636')

The computer science externals can be particularly time consuming for Merit and Excellence.
For some students, it is better to just focus on doing the Achieved material well.
For this reason, we provide separate guides for students aiming for subject endorsement and for students aiming to get the credits.

# AS91371 (2.44)

- [Level 2 Introduction]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'as91371')

For 2.44, students will need to do **one** project on data representation (each data representation guide contains two data types), **three** projects for encoding, and **one** project for human computer interaction.
They must do one encoding project for each of the three encoding areas - compression, error control coding, and encryption.

The guides the student picks will depend on whether they are aiming for Merit/Excellence, or on just getting the credits.
Note that Merit/Excellence for this standard requires time, commitment and a willingness to do additional reading.

## Representing Data

**Achieved Guides**

For Achieved, students will only need to choose 1 guide. The guides cover 2 data representation topics, fully covering the requirements for data representation at Achieved.

- [Representing Data - Representing numbers and text with bits (Achieved)]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'achieved-representing-data')

**Merit/Excellence Guides**

For Merit/Excellence, students will need to choose 2 guides. Each guide covers 1 different data representation topic.

- [Representing Text - Unicode (Merit/Excellence)]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'excellence-data-representation-text')
- [Representing Numbers - Two's Complement (Merit/Excellence)]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'excellence-data-representation-numbers')
- [Representing Colour - Various colour depths (Merit/Excellence)]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'excellence-data-representation-colour')

## Encoding

**For Achieved**, students need to pick **three Achieved projects** with one from each of the three encoding topics (giving a total of 3 encoding projects)

**For Merit/Excellence**, students need to pick **one Excellence project** from one of the three encoding topics, and **two Achieved projects**; with one from each of the other two encoding topics (giving a total of 3 encoding projects).

Note that we are currently updating Merit/Excellence guides to better match the expectations for students working at these levels.

### Error Control coding

**Achieved Guides**

- [Encoding - Error Control Coding with check sums (Achieved)]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'achieved-error-control-check-sums')
- [Encoding - Error Control Coding with parity (Achieved)]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'achieved-error-control-parity')

**Merit/Excellence Guides**

No Merit/Excellence guides currently available.

### Compression

**Achieved Guides**

- [Encoding - Compression with Run Length Encoding (Achieved) ]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'achieved-compression-run-length-encoding')

**Merit/Excellence Guides**

No Merit/Excellence guides currently available.

### Encryption

**Achieved Guides**

- [Encoding - Encryption with Caesar Cipher (Achieved)]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'achieved-encryption-caesar-cipher')

**Merit/Excellence Guides**

No Merit/Excellence guides currently available.

## Human Computer Interaction

Students will need to pick **one** project from here. Which they pick will depend on whether they are aiming for Merit/Excellence or Achieved.

**Achieved Guides**

- For Achieved: [Human Computer Interaction - identifying heuristic violations in every day life (Achieved)]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'achieved-human-computer-interaction')

**Merit/Excellence Guides**

- For Merit/Excellence: [Human Computer Interaction - evaluating an interface with heuristics (Merit/Excellence) ]('curriculum_guides:curriculum_guide_section' 'ncea' 'full-human-computer-interaction')

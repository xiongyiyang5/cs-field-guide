# Algorithms

{comment explain different views of algorithm (programming context) and Algorithm (that have interesting complexity); use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hfOvs8pY1k for the former?}

## What's the big picture?

Every computer device you have ever used, from your school computers to your calculator, has been using algorithms to tell it how to do whatever it was doing. Algorithms are a very important topic in Computer Science because they help software developers create efficient and error free programs. The most important thing to remember about algorithms is that there can be many different algorithms for the same problem, but some are much better than others!

Computers are incredibly fast at manipulating, moving and looking through data. However the amount of data computers use is often so large that it doesn't matter how fast the computer is, it will take it far too long to examine every single piece of data (companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter routinely process billions of things per day, and in some cases, per minute!) This is where algorithms come in. If a computer is given a better algorithm to process the data then it doesn't matter how much information it has to look through, it will still be able to do it in a reasonable amount of time.

If you have read through the Introduction chapter you may remember that the speed of an application on a computer makes a big difference to a human using it. If an application you create is too slow, people will get frustrated with it and won't use it. It doesn't matter if your software is amazing,
if it takes too long they will simply give up and try something else!

### Algorithms, Programs and Informal Instructions

At this stage you might be thinking that algorithms and computer programs kind of sound like the same thing, but they are actually two very distinct concepts.
They are each different ways of describing how to do something, but at different levels of precision:

Often you can get away with describing a process just using some sort of informal instructions using natural language; for example, an informal instruction in a non computing context might be
"please get me a glass of water".
A human can understand what this means and can figure out how to accomplish this task by thinking, but a computer would have no idea how to do this!

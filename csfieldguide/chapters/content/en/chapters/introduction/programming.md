## Programming

And what about programming? You can get through this whole guide without doing any programming, although we'll suggest exercises.
Ultimately, however, all the concepts here are reflected in programs that people write.
If you want to learn programming there are many excellent courses available.
It takes time and practice, and is well worth doing in parallel with working through the topics in this guide.
There are a number of free online systems and books that you can use to teach yourself programming.
A list of options for all ages learning to program is available at [www.code.org](https://code.org/educate/allhourofcode), where there is also a popular video of some well-known high-fliers in computing that is good to show classes.

Programming is just one of the skills you'll need to be a computer scientist.
In this book you'll be exercising many other skills --- maths, psychology, and communication are important ones.

## How to use this guide

This guide is intended to support a variety of curricula, and teacher guides will become available for using it in different contexts.
For students, we've designed most chapters so that they can stand alone; the few that build on previous chapters explain at the outset what preparation you need (the most useful general preparation is the chapter on data representation, because everything on a computer is stored using binary numbers and so they have an important role in many areas of computer science.)

Each chapter begins with a section about the "big picture" --- why the topic is useful for understanding and designing computer systems, and what can be achieved using the main ideas in the chapter.
You'll then be introduced to key ideas and applications of the topic through examples, and wherever possible we'll have interactive activities that enable you to work with the ideas first hand.
Sometimes these will be simplified versions of the full sized problems that computer scientists need to deal with -- our intention is for you to actually interact with the ideas, not just read about them. Make sure you give them a go!

We finish each chapter by talking about the "whole story," giving hints about parts of the topic that we omitted because we didn't want to make the chapter too overwhelming.
There will be pointers for further reading, but be warned that some of it might be quite deep, and require advanced math or programming skills.

If you are doing this for formal study, you'll end up having to do some sort of assessment.
The curriculum guides provide ideas for projects and activities that could be used for this.

It is currently available online, and as a downloadable PDF file (although it's much better viewed in the other formats because you can watch the videos and use the interactive activities).
The source material (all raw text, images, videos and interactive programs) is available through the "Contribute on GitHub" link.

## Further reading

Each chapter gives suggestions for further reading for that particular topic. There are also plenty of general books and websites about computer science that you might want to read to keep your view of the topic broad.

Books that we particularly recommend include:

- Algorithmics, by David Harel
- [Computational fairy tales](http://computationaltales.blogspot.co.nz), by Jeremy Kubica
- Algorithmic adventures: from knowledge to magic, by Jurag Hromkovic
- The Turing Omnibus, by A.K. Dewdney

Wikipedia has a fairly extensive [entry on computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science).

The AQA Computing A2 book(s), by Sylvia Langfield and Kevin Bond, give a more detailed account of many of these topics.

There are also some excellent general web sites about Computer Science, many of which we've referenced in other chapters:

- [Computer Science For Fun](http://www.cs4fn.org) --- a very readable collection of short articles about practical applications of topics in computer science
- [Babbage's bag](http://www.i-programmer.info/babbages-bag/) is an excellent collection of technical articles on many topics in computing.
- [CS Bytes](http://www.nsf.gov/cise/csbytes/) has up-to-date articles about applications of computer science.
- [Thriving in our digital world](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~engage/) has some excellent information and  interactive material on topics from computer science.
- [The Virginia tech online interactive modules for teaching computer science](http://courses.cs.vt.edu/csonline/) cover a range of relevant topics.
- [CS animated](http://www.csanimated.com/) has interactive activities on computer science.
- [CS for All](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall/)

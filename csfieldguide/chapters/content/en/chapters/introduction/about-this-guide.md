Of course, we welcome donations to support further work on the guide.

## Further reading

Each chapter gives suggestions for further reading for that particular topic. There are also plenty of general books and websites about computer science that you might want to read to keep your view of the topic broad.

Books that we particularly recommend include:

- Algorithmics, by David Harel
- [Computational fairy tales](http://computationaltales.blogspot.co.nz), by Jeremy Kubica
- Algorithmic adventures: from knowledge to magic, by Jurag Hromkovic
- The Turing Omnibus, by A.K. Dewdney

Wikipedia has a fairly extensive [entry on computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science).

The AQA Computing A2 book(s), by Sylvia Langfield and Kevin Bond, give a more detailed account of many of these topics.

There are also some excellent general web sites about Computer Science, many of which we've referenced in other chapters:

- [Computer Science For Fun](http://www.cs4fn.org) --- a very readable collection of short articles about practical applications of topics in computer science
- [Babbage's bag](http://www.i-programmer.info/babbages-bag/) is an excellent collection of technical articles on many topics in computing.
- [CS Bytes](http://www.nsf.gov/cise/csbytes/) has up-to-date articles about applications of computer science.
- [Thriving in our digital world](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~engage/) has some excellent information and  interactive material on topics from computer science.
- [The Virginia tech online interactive modules for teaching computer science](http://courses.cs.vt.edu/csonline/) cover a range of relevant topics.
- [CS animated](http://www.csanimated.com/) has interactive activities on computer science.
- [CS for All](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall/)

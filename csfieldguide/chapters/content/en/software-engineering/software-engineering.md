# Challenges in teaching Software Engineering

Software engineering is a challenging topic to teach for several reasons.
One is that many, if not most, textbooks aren't written by practising software engineers, and often contain outdated ideas that are difficult for students to understand anyway (for example, the waterfall model is often taught near the start, and yet often doesnâ€™t work in practice, and in fact was originally written to tell people how *not* to do software engineering).

Furthermore, to get real experience with software engineering would involve being on a team of qualified engineers working on a project with vague and changing needs.
This is very difficult in educational settings where the norm is individual work being done by inexperienced students who are given clear criteria on which they will be graded.

In this chapter we've tried to capture what really happens in industry, and suggest activities that will give students a realistic view of what is involved.

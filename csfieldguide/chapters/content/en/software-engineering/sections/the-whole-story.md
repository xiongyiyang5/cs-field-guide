# The whole story!

In this chapter, we’ve tried to give you an introduction to the challenges of creating software and some techniques that software engineers use to overcome them.
We’ve really only scratched the surface of software analysis, design, testing and software processes; there are entire books about each of these areas!

It can be difficult to understand the importance of some of the problems and techniques described here if you have never worked on a larger software project yourself.
Some may seem blindingly obvious to you, others may seem irrelevant.
When you work on your first large project, come back to this chapter and hopefully you’ll recognise some of the problems described here!

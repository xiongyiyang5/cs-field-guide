# Image compression using JPEG

Images can take up a lot of space, and most of the time that pictures are stored on a computer they are compressed to avoid wasting too much space.
With a lot of images (especially photographs), there's no need to store the image exactly as it was originally, because it contains way more detail than anyone can see.
This can lead to considerable savings in space, especially if the details that are missing are the kind that people have trouble perceiving.
This kind of compression is called lossy compression.
There are other situations where images need to be stored exactly as they were in the original, such as for medical scans or very high quality photograph processing, and in these cases lossless methods are used, or the images aren't compressed at all (e.g. using RAW format on cameras).

In the data representation section we looked at how the size of an image file can be reduced by using fewer bits to describe the colour of each pixel.
However, image compression methods such as JPEG take advantage of patterns in the image to reduce the space needed to represent it, without impacting the image unnecessarily.

The following three images show the difference between reducing bit depth and using a specialised image compression system.
The left hand image is the original, which was 24 bits per pixel.
The middle image has been compressed to one third of the original size using JPEG; while it is a "lossy" version of the original, the difference is unlikely to be perceptible.
The right hand one has had the number of colours reduced to 256, so there are 8 bits per pixel instead of 24, which means it is also stored in a third of the original size.
Even though it has lost just as many bits, the information removed has had much more impact on how it looks.
This is the advantage of JPEG: it removes information in the image that doesn't have so much impact on the perceived quality.
Furthermore, with JPEG, you can choose the tradeoff between quality and file size.

Reducing the number of bits (the colour depth) is sufficiently crude that we don't really regard it as a compression method, but just a low quality representation.
Image compression methods like JPEG, GIF and PNG are designed to take advantage of the patterns in an image to get a good reduction in file size without losing more quality than necessary.

{comment xtcb low priority: these are all jpgs of the originals; consider replacing them with actual originals (as long as the browser can render them all). ..ajb these images seem to appear in the wrong order to what is described for meâ€¦ The middle one and left one should be swapped around?}

For example, the following image shows a zoomed in view of the pixels that are part of the detail around an eye from the above (high quality) image.

{image file-path="img/chapters/zoomed-eye.png"}

Notice that the colours in adjacent pixels are often very similar, even in this part of the picture that has a lot of detail.
For example, the pixels shown in the red box below just change gradually from very dark to very light.

{image file-path="img/chapters/zoomed-eye-highlighted.png"}

Run-length encoding wouldn't work in this situation.
You could use a variation that specifies a pixel's colour, and then says how many of the following pixels are the same colour, but although most adjacent pixels are nearly the same, the chances of them being identical are very low, and there would be almost no runs of identical colours.

But there is a way to take advantage of the gradually changing colours.
For the pixels in the red box above, you could generate an approximate version of those colours by specifying just the first and last one, and getting the computer to calculate the ones in between assuming that the colour changes gradually between them.
Instead of storing 5 pixel values, only 2 are needed, yet someone viewing it probably might not notice any difference.
This would be *lossy* because you can't reproduce the original exactly, but it would be good enough for a lot of purposes, and save a lot of space.

# Interpolation

The process of guessing the colours of pixels between two that are known is an example of {glossary-link term="interpolation" reference-text="compressing images"}interpolation{glossary-link end}.

A *linear* interpolation assumes that the values increase at a constant rate between the two given values; for example, for the five pixels above, suppose the first pixel has a blue colour value of 124, and the last one has a blue value of 136,
then a linear interpolation would guess that the blue values for the ones in between are 127, 130 and 133, and this would save storing them.
In practice, a more complex approach is used to guess what the pixels are, but linear interpolation gives the idea of what's going on.

{panel end}

The JPEG system, which is widely used for photos, uses a more sophisticated version of this idea.
Instead of taking a 5 by 1 run of pixels as we did above, it works with 8 by 8 blocks of pixels.
And instead of estimating the values with a linear function, it uses combinations of cosine waves.

{comment It would be good have a figure that shows a line of pixels, and the corresponding waveform.}

# What are cosine waves

A cosine wave form is from the trig function that is often used for calculating the sides of a triangle.
If you plot the cosine value from 0 to 180 degrees, you get a smooth curve going from 1 to -1.
Variations of this plot can be used to approximate the value of pixels, going from one colour to another.
If you add in a higher frequency cosine wave, you can produce interesting shapes.
In theory, any pattern of pixels can be created by adding together different cosine waves!

The following graph shows the values of {math}\sin(x){math end} and {math}\cos(x){math end} for {math}x{math end} ranging from 0 to 180 degrees.

# Adding sine or cosine waves to create any waveform

JPEGs (and MP3) are based on the idea that you can add together lots of sine or cosine waves to create any waveform that you want.
Converting a waveform for a block of pixels or sample of music into a sum of simple waves can be done using a technique called a [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform), and is a widely used idea in signal processing.

You can experiment with adding sine waves together to generate other shapes using the
[spreadsheet provided](files/Adding-Sine-Waves.xls).
In this spreadsheet, the yellow region on the first sheet allows you to choose which sine waves to add.
Try setting the 4 sine waves to frequencies that are 3, 9, 15, and 21 times the fundamental frequency respectively (the "fundamental" is the lowest frequency.)
Now set the "amplitude" (equivalent to volume level) of the four to 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.0625 respectively (each is half of the previous one).
This should produce the following four sine waves:

{image file-path="img/chapters/sine-waves.png" alt="Four sine waves"}

When the above four waves are added together, they interfere with each other, and produce a shape that has sharper transitions:

{image file-path="img/chapters/sine-waves-sum.png" alt="The four sine waves added together"}

In fact, if you were to continue the pattern with more than four sine waves, this shape would become a "square wave", which is one that suddenly goes to the maximum value, and then suddenly to the minimum.
The one shown above is bumpy because we've only used 4 sine waves to describe it.

This is exactly what is going on in JPEG if you compress a black and white image.
The "colour" of pixels as you go across the image will either be 0 (black) or full intensity (white), but JPEG will approximate it with a small number of cosine waves (which have basically the same properties as sine waves.)
This gives the "overshoot" that you see in the image above; in a JPEG image, this comes out as bright and dark patches surrounding the sudden change of colour, like here:

{image file-path="img/chapters/jpeg-word-zoomed.jpg"}

You can experiment with different combinations of sine waves to get different shapes.
You may need to have more than four to get good approximations to a shape that you want; that's exactly the tradeoff that JPEG is making.
There are some suggestions for parameters on the second sheet of the spreadsheet.

You can also learn about Fourier transforms using the Wolfram Alpha software; this will require you to install a browser plugin.
The Wolfram demonstrations include:
[an interactive demonstration of JPEG](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/JPEGCompressionAlgorithm/),
[showing the relationship between sine saves and creating other waveforms](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/RecoveringTheFourierCoefficients/), and

You can see the 8 by 8 blocks of pixels if you zoom in on a heavily compressed JPEG image.
For example, the following image has been very heavily compressed using JPEG (it is just 1.5% of its original size).

{image file-path="img/chapters/compressed-jpeg.png"}

If we zoom in on the eye area, you can see the 8 x 8 blocks of pixels:

{image file-path="img/chapters/compressed-jpeg-zoomed.png"}

Notice that there is very little variation across each block.
In the following image the block in the red box only changes from top to bottom, and could probably be specified by giving just two values, and having the ones in between calculated by the decoder as for the line example before.
The green square only varies from left to right, and again might only need 2 values stored instead of 64.
The blue block has only one colour in it! The yellow block is more complicated because there is more activity in that part of the image, which is where the cosine waves come in.
A "wave" value varies up and down, so this one can be represented by a left-to-right variation from dark to light to dark, and a top-to-bottom variation mainly from dark to light.
Thus still only a few values need to be stored instead of the full 64.

{image file-path="img/chapters/compressed-jpeg-zoomed-highlighted.png"}

The quality is quite low, but the saving in space is huge â€“ it's more than 60 times smaller (for example, it would download 60 times faster).
Higher quality JPEG images store more detail for each 8 by 8 block, which makes it closer to the original image, but makes bigger files because more details are being stored.
You can experiment with these tradeoffs by saving JPEGs with differing choices of the quality, and see how the file size changes.
Most image processing software offers this option when you save an image as a JPEG.

# Where does the term JPEG come from?

The name "JPEG" is short for "Joint Photographic Experts Group", a committee that was formed in the 1980s to create standards so that digital photographs could be captured and displayed on different brands of devices.
Because some file extensions are limited to three characters, it is often seen as the ".jpg" extension.

# More about cosine waves

The cosine waves used for JPEG images are based on a "Discrete Cosine Transform".
The "Discrete" means that the waveform is digital â€“ it is the opposite of continuous, where any value can occur.
In a JPEG wave, there are only 8 x 8 values (for the block being coded), and each of those values can have a limited range of numbers (binary integers), rather than any value at all.

{panel end}

An important issue arises because JPEG represents images as smoothly varying colours: what happens if the colours change suddenly?
In that case, lots of values need to be stored so that lots of cosine waves can be added together to make the sudden change in colour, or else the edge of the image become fuzzy.
You can think of it as the cosine waves overshooting on the sudden changes, producing artifacts like the ones in the following image where the edges are messy.

{image file-path="img/chapters/jpeg-word.jpg"}

The original had sharp edges, but this zoomed in view of the JPEG version of it show that not only are the edges gradual, but some darker pixels occur further into the white space, looking a bit like shadows or echoes.

{image file-path="img/chapters/jpeg-word-zoomed.jpg"}

For this reason, JPEG is used for photos and natural images, but other techniques (such as GIF and PNG, which we will look at in another section) work better for artificial images like this one.

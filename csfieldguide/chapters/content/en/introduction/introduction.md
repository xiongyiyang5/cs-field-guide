# Introduction for teachers

This guide is an online interactive textbook to support teaching computer science in high schools.
It was initially developed to support the new achievement standards in Computer Science that are being rolled out in New Zealand from 2011 to 2013,
but eventually will be expanded to support other curricula.

The version that you are reading now is the teachers' version, in which chapters are interspersed with information for teachers, like this box.
It will include answers and hints, so this version shouldn't be released to students (although because the material is open-source, a resourceful student may well find the teachers' version).

Because the guide is constantly under revision, we welcome feedback so that we can improve, clarify, and correct the material.
The best way to provide feedback is through the "Give us feedback" link (this can range from a typo to a broad suggestion).
You can also contact us about more general matters by emailing jack.morgan@canterbury.ac.nz, or tim.bell@canterbury.ac.nz .

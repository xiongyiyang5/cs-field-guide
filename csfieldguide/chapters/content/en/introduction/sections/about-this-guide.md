# About this guide

This guide is free for you to copy, share and even modify.
It is currently available online, and as a downloadable PDF file (although it's much better viewed in the other formats because you can watch the videos and use the interactive activities).
The source material (all raw text, images, videos and interactive programs) is available through the "Contribute on GitHub" link.

If you do make improvements, we ask that you share those, and acknowledge this guide by linking back to our web site. You can give away the guide (or any derivatives), and you can use it for teaching, but youâ€™re not allowed to sell it directly for profit.

Production of the guide was partially funded by a generous grant from Google Inc., and supported by the University of Canterbury.
Of course, we welcome donations to support further work on the guide.

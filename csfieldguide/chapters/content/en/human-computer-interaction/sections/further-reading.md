# Further reading

- The book "Designing with the mind in mind" by Jeff Johnson provides excellent background reading for many of the issues discussed in this chapter.

- The [cs4fn website has a lot of articles and activities on Human Computer Interaction](http://www.cs4fn.org/fundamentals/hci.php), such as [problems around reporting interface problems](http://www.cs4fn.org/chi-med/reportingincidents.php), [cultural issues in interface design](http://www.cs4fn.org/usability/tzeltal.php), and [The importance of Sushi](http://www.cs4fn.org/usability/importanceofsushi.php).

- A classic book relating to usability is "The psychology of everyday things" (later re-titled "The design of everyday things") by Don Norman.
It's about everyday objects like doors and phones, and it was written a while ago, but it contains lots of thought provoking and often humorous examples.

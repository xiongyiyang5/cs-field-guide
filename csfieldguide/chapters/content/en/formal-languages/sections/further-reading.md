## Books

Textbooks on formal languages will have considerably more advanced material and more mathematical rigour than could be expected at High School level, but for students who really want to read more, a popular book is "Introduction to the Theory of Computation" by Michael Sipser.

Regular expressions and their relationship with FSAs is explained well in the book "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick.

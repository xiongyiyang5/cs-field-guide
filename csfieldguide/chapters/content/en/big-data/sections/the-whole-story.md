# The Whole Story

Big Data gives us an opportunity to gain a much deeper understanding about how many things in our world work, we are barely scratching the surface of the possibilities and it is undeniably a new and exciting field to be in.
So new and influential in fact that there is now huge demand for those with Data Science skills.
Data Scientists are people with the skills and knowledge to accurately analyse Big Data.
With the amount of data we are collecting each day growing rapidly, itâ€™s not surprising that this new field has popped up.

<!-- Report from Linkedin in mid 2018 reported that demand for people with data science skills is huge. https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/resources/linkedin-workforce-report-august-2018 -->

But not only is there a huge demand for experts in this field, there is also demand for innovation.
We are already pushing the limits of the infrastructure supporting big data, and there is plenty of space for creative solutions to solve this problem.

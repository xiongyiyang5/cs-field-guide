# The whole story!

In this chapter so far, we have only talked about one application of AI.
AI contains many more exciting applications, such as computers that are able to play board games against humans, computers that are able to learn, and computers that are able to control robots that are autonomously exploring an environment too dangerous for humans to enter.

Below is an interactive demonstrating how an AI can use a basic artificial neural network to learn how to play a game.
Put simply, if the AI (Nathaniel) wins a match it will be encouraged to make the same moves again.
If it loses, it will be encouraged to make different moves.
Over many hundreds of games the AI will learn to make specific moves rather than pick each one at random.
Eventually further sections on neural networks and other topics in AI will be added to this chapter.

# The whole story!

In this chapter so far, we have only talked about one application of AI.
AI contains many more exciting applications, such as computers that are able to play board games against humans, computers that are able to learn, and computers that are able to control robots that are autonomously exploring an environment too dangerous for humans to enter.

Eventually further sections on other topics in AI will be added to this chapter.

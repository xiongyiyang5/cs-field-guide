# Algorithms

{comment explain different views of algorithm (programming context) and Algorithm (that have interesting complexity); use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hfOvs8pY1k for the former?}

Every computer device you have ever used, from your school computers to your calculator, has been using algorithms to tell it how to do whatever it was doing.
Algorithms are a very important topic in Computer Science because they help software developers create efficient and error free programs.
The most important thing to remember about algorithms is that there can be many different algorithms for the same problem, but some are much better than others!

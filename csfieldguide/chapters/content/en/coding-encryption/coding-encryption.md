# Coding - Encryption

{glossary-link term="encryption"}Encryption{glossary-link end} is used to keep data secret.
In its simplest form, a file or data transmission is garbled so that only authorised people with a secret {glossary-link term="encryption-key"}key{glossary-link end} can unlock the original text.
If you're using digital devices then you'll be using systems based on encryption all the time: when you use online banking, when you access data through wifi, when you pay for something with a credit card (either by swiping, inserting or tapping), in fact, nearly every activity will involve layers of encryption.
Without encryption, your information would be wide open to the world &ndash; anyone could pull up outside a house and read all the data going over your wifi, and stolen laptops, hard disks and SIM cards would yield all sorts of information about you &ndash; so encryption is critical to make computer systems usable.

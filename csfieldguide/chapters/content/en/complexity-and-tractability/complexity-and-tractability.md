# Large numbers ahead!

This chapter deals a lot with very large numbers and especially the problem of exponential explosion of time taken.
There are a number of resources around that illustrate these concepts.
The video [The Power of Exponentials, Big and Small](http://blossoms.mit.edu/videos/lessons/power_exponentials_big_and_small) from MIT is downloadable, and illustrates exponential growth with some humorous examples.

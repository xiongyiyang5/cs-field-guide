# Bin Packing Problem

The bin packing problem is another intractable problem that is encountered in many different forms in everyday life.
In the bin packing problem there are a number of items of varying sizes and the goal is to minimise the number of bins required to fit all the items.
A real life example of this would be packing boxes into the back of a truck.

There is no known tractable solution to this problem, which means that we only currently have exponential-time algorithms that work out the minimum number of bins needed.
However, there are a number of heuristics that can very quickly give a non-optimal solution.
One of these is the first fit algorithm.
This algorithm uses the following steps:

1. Select an item.
2. Place it in the first bin that has space available for it.
   If there are no bins with space, add a new bin.

These steps are repeated until there are no items left.

A variation of the first fit algorithm involves sorting the items in decreasing order first.
This means the largest items are packed first.

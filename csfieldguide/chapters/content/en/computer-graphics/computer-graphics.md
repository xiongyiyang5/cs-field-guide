# Computer Graphics

Computer graphics will be familiar from games, films and images, and there is amazing software available to create images, but how does the software work?
The role of a computer scientist is not just to *use* graphics systems, but to *create* them, and especially invent new techniques.

The entertainment industry is always trying to develop new graphics software so that they can push the boundaries and create new experiences.
We've seen this in the evolution of animated films, from simple 2D films to realistic computer generated movies with detailed 3D images.
The names of dozens of computer scientists now regularly appear in the credits for films that us CGI or animation, and [some have even won Oscars for their innovative software](http://www.oscars.org/news/11-scientific-and-technical-achievements-be-honored-academy-awardsr)!

Movie and gaming companies can't always just use existing software to make the next great thing â€” they need computer scientists to come up with better graphics techniques to make something that's never been seen before.
The creative possibilities are endless!

Computer graphics are used in a wide variety of situations: games and animated movies are common examples, but graphics techniques are also used to visualise large amounts of data (such as all cellphone calls being made in one day or friend connections in a social network), to display and animate graphical user interfaces, to create virtual reality and augmented reality worlds, and much more.

# Pixels


A digital image on a screen or printer is physically made up of a grid of tiny squares called {glossary-link term="pixel" reference-text="definition"}pixels{glossary-link end}.
They are usually too small to see easily (otherwise the image would look blocky).
Photographs usually use millions of pixels (a megapixel is a million pixels; for example, a screen that is 1080 pixels across and 720 down would contain 777,600 pixels, or 0.7776 megapixels).

The pixels is fundamental to computer graphics, as a lot of the work of computer graphics programmers is taking some abstract idea (such as objects in a scene), and working out the colour each pixel should be to make the viewer think they are looking at the scene.
A digital camera also does this - but it just senses the colour falling on each of its millions of sensors, and stores those so that the pixels can be displayed when needed.

In this chapter we'll look at some of the basic techniques that are used to create computer graphics.
These will give you an idea of the techniques that are used in graphics programming, although it's just the beginning of what's possible.

For this chapter we are using a system called WebGL which can render 3D graphics in your browser.
If your browser is up to date everything should be fine.
If you have issues, or if the performance is poor, there is [information here about how to get it going]('appendices:appendix' 'interactives').

# Computer Graphics

You will be familiar with {glossary-link term="computer-graphics"}computer graphics{glossary-link end} from games, films and images, and there is amazing software available to create images, but how does the software work?
The role of a computer scientist is not just to *use* graphics systems, but to *create* them, and especially invent new techniques.

The entertainment industry is always trying to develop new graphics software so that they can push the boundaries and create new experiences.
We've seen this in the evolution of animated films, from simple 2D films to realistic computer generated movies with detailed 3D images.
The names of dozens of computer scientists now regularly appear in the credits for films that use CGI or animation, and [some have even won Oscars for their innovative software](http://www.oscars.org/news/11-scientific-and-technical-achievements-be-honored-academy-awardsr)!

{comment consider showing e.g. animated files Lion King - Shrek - Toy Story - Avatar sequence of improvements}

# Substitution cipher

A type of cipher that works simply by replacing each letter or combination of letters in a plain text with a certain other letter or combination of letters to make up the cipher text.
The result of this is that each unique letter combination of letters in the plain text (e.g. "t") is represented by the same unique letter combination of letters in the cipher text (e.g. "y").
Caesar Cipher is a simple example of a substitution cipher.
Substitution ciphers are vulnerable to Frequency Analysis Attacks, so are not used in practice.

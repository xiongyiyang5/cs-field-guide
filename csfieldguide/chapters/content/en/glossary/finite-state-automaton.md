# Finite state automaton

In formal languages, a finite state automaton (FSA) is a simple 'machine' that has states, and transitions from one state to another based on strings of input symbols.

The logic for FSAs and regular expressions are interchangeable &ndash; every FSA has an equivalent regular expression, and vice versa.

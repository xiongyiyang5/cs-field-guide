# Grammar

In formal languages, a set of grammars is a set of rules for specifying a formal language, for example, to specify syntax for programming languages.

Unlike regular expressions, grammars don't specify a sequential pattern the language needs to follow.
Instead it defines a set of building blocks the language can use.

# Hexadecimal colour codes

A representation for colours that tells the computer how much red, blue, and green light to display in a pixel (to make the desired colour).
Uses 1 byte for each of these 3 primary colours, which is 3 bytes (24 bits) in total.
These 24 bits are often written as 6 hexadecimal digits to make them easier for humans to read, which is why they are called "Hexadecimal colour codes".
They are commonly encountered when specificying colours in HTML for web pages.

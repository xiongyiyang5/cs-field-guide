# Task

Something a user might do with a piece of software or electronic device to achieve a goal.
In the case of a cellphone this might be "send a text message" or in the case of a microwave it might be "heat up yesterdayâ€™s leftovers".
Interfaces are best evaluated when considering how they help a user to perform a task.

# Syntactically correct

A string is syntactically correct if it matches the specifications for a formal language. For example, the string "()(())" is correct for a grammar that gives the rules for balanced parentheses.
In a computer program, a syntax error is when a character occurs in the input which isnâ€™t allowed, and the program is therefore not syntactically correct.

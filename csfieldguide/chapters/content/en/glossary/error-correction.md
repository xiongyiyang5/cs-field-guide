# Error correction

Correcting an error that has been detected in some data.
This can be demonstrated in the Parity trick, where a person is able to flip the changed bit back over so it is correct again (after they have "detected" which bit was incorrect).
Not all error control schemes are able to correct errors; some are only able to detect them.

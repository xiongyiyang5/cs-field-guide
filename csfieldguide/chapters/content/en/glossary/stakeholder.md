# Stakeholder

A stakeholder is any person/people who could affect or be affected by a project.
For example if you were designing a bridge, the stakeholders would be:

- Yourself
- The organisation paying for the bridge
- The company building the bridge
- Those who will use the bridge
- People who live near the construction site
- Relevant government officials

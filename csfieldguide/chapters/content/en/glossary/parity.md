# Parity

Adding an extra bit to a set of bits to make it so that there is an even number of 1’s.
Storing the parity makes it possible to detect and correct errors later.
This is known as an even parity bit; an odd parity bit is also possible where the extra bit ensures there is an odd number of 1’s.

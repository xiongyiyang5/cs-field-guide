# Hexadecimal

The base 16 number system. Uses the digits "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "F".
All numbers that can be represented in decimal can be uniquely represented in hexadecimal (just like binary).
It is most often used as a shorthand notation for binary, by assigning 1 hexadecimal digit to each 4 bit pattern (the assigning is done in numeric order).

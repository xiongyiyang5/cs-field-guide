# Heuristic

A heuristic is rule or guideline, usually devised from experience.
The term is used in both HCI and algorithms.
In HCI, heuristics are often used as a benchmark to evaluate interfaces — they aren’t strict rules, but usually highlight issues with designs.
A very common set is given at [Nielsen Norman Group website](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).
In algorithms, and heuristic is an approximate solution to a problem; it doesn’t guarantee to give the best possible answer (such as the shortest route on a map), but by using simple rules the calculation can be done quickly, and the solution is hopefully good enough for practical use.

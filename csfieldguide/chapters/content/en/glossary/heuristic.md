# Heuristic

A heuristic is rule or guideline, usually devised from experience.
The term is used in both HCI and algorithms.
In HCI, heuristics are often used as a benchmark to evaluate interfaces &ndash; they arenâ€™t strict rules, but usually highlight issues with designs.
In algorithms, a heuristic is an approximate solution to a problem &ndash; intended as a quick, close enough calculation rather than a precise, impossibly long one.

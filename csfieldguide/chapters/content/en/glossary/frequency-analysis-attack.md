# Frequency analysis attack

An attack on substitution ciphers that takes advantage of the fact that some letters are generally more common than others in a piece of text (e.g. in English, the letter "e" is usually the most common letter) by looking at which letters appear the most in the cipher text and guessing that they must be the substitutions for the most common letters.

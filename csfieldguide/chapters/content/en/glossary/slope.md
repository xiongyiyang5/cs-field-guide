# Slope

This is a way of expressing the angle or gradient of a line.
The slope is simply how far up the line goes for every unit we move to the right.
For example, if we have a line with a slope of 2, then after moving 3 units to the right, it will have gone up 6 units.
A line with a slope of 0 is horizontal.
Normally the slope of a line is represented using the symbol \( m \).

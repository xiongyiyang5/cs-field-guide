# Math in data representation

A lot of the exercises in this chapter involve simple arithmetic.
If students struggle to do this by hand, a lot can be done using spreadsheets.

Computers are machines that do stuff with information.
They let you view, listen, create, and edit information in documents, images, videos, sound, spreadsheets and databases.
They let you play games in simulated worlds that don’t really exist except as information inside the computer’s memory and displayed on the screen.
They let you compute and calculate with numerical information; they let you send and receive information over networks.
Fundamental to all of this is that the computer has to represent that information in some way inside the computer’s memory, as well as storing it on disk or sending it over a network.

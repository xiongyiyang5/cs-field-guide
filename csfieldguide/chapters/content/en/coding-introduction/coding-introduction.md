# Coding - Introduction

The word "code" has lots of meanings in computer science.
It's often used to talk about programming, and a program can be referred to as "source code".
Even binary representation of information is sometimes referred to as a code.
However, in this chapter (and the next three chapters),
the sense of coding that will be used is about clever representations of information that address a practical issue, such as encrypting the data to keep it secret.

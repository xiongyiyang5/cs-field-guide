"""
Measures the relative speeds of linear search and binary search.

The current output is human readable, but for large-scale experiments you will
want to modify it so that the output can be graphed
(e.g. generate CSV to put in a spreadsheet, or introduce a plotting library).
You should also consider generating special cases of searches, such as
searching for the last item in a list.

The following constants should be modified to run the experiments
on a wider range of data:
NUMBER_OF_KEYS
NUMBER_OF_REPEATED_EXPERIMENTS

This is for Python version 2.7.

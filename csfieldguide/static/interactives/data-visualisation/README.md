This game serves to teach students that visualisation can help a user quickly identify trends in data, and that some visualisations are more helpful than others.

## The Game

The user is presented with a data set for a short period, then expected to enter the mode (most common value) of the data.
This process is repeated with different visualisation techniques, including: a grid, heatmap, pie chart and bar chart.

## Licences

This interactive uses [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).
Its licence, and that of the original game, is listed in `LICENCE-THIRD-PARTY`, with a full copy available in the `third-party-licences` directory.

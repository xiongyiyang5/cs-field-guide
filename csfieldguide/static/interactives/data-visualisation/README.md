This game serves to teach students that visualisation can help a user quickly identify trends in data, and that some visualisations are more helpful than others.

## The Game

The user is presented with a data set for a short period, then expected to enter the mode (most common value) of the data.
This process is repeated with different visualisation techniques, including: a grid, heatmap, pie chard and bar chart.

## Licences

# Payment Interface Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for the HCI chapter in giving the user experience with an awful interface. The interface only accepts payment amounts with specific characters.

## Required Files

The interactive loads from a base website template which includes a JavaScript file containing jQuery, Bootstrap, and a few other utilities and polyfills.
See `static/js/website.js` for a full list.

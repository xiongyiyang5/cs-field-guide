# Sorting Algorithm Comparison Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for the algorithms chapter to show the difference between selection and quick sort. The animations are provided by David Martin from [www.sorting-algorithms.com](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/).

## Required Files

The interactive loads from a base website template which includes a JavaScript file containing jQuery, Bootstrap, and a few other utilities and polyfills.
See `static/js/website.js` for a full list.

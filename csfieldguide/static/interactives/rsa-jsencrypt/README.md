# RSA JSEncrypt

**Original Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for the encryption chapter in allowing the user to encrypt and decrypt text using RSA public and private keys, using the `jsencrypt.js` library.

## Usage

The interactive opens by default in encrypting mode. To access the decrypting mode, the parameter `mode` must be passed with the value `decrypt` (by adding `?mode=decrypt` to the end of the URL).

## Required Files

The interactive loads from a base website template which includes a JavaScript file containing jQuery, Bootstrap, and a few other utilities and polyfills.
See `static/js/website.js` for a full list.

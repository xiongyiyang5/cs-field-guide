# Huffman Tree Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created to allow users to generate Huffman Trees, in the same style of the diagrams within the chapter.

## Required files

- The interactive also requires `vis-lite.js` from https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js. Its licence file is listed in `LICENCE-THIRD-PARTY` and included in the `third-party-licences` directory.

     * after one second.
     * This will put it one second ahead of packet X+3.
     * If packet X is delayed a second time, it will resume its animation
     * from the start after two seconds.
     * The extra second is to prevent it overlapping packet X+5.
     * This results in packet X taking the same space as packet X+3 would if it
     * were also delayed.
     * 
     * The overlap will only occur after (a minimum of) three specific delays
     * (packet X twice, then packet X+3) so for now it is safe not to worry about.

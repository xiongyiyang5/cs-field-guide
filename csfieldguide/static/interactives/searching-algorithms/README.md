# Searching Algorithms Interactive

**Original Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for teaching searching algorithms, in particular binary search.

Viewing the `index.html` file will run the interactive, with two parameters available for setting which levels to run within the interactive (level numbers start from 1):
- `level` - Start from this level number, takes a number from 1 to 5 inclusive.
- `max` - Return to the main menu after completing this level, takes a number from 1 to 5 inclusive.

For example, loading `index.html?level=3&max=4` will run only levels 3 and 4.

## Required Files

- This interactive was created in the Premium version of [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2), as it uses the 'Family mechanic'. To edit the Construct 2 project file, open the `.capx` file found in the project-files folder.
- The website runs in a browser using HTML5 and JS (through jQuery).

## Future Plans

- Tidy project files, delete unnecessary files.
- Allow everyone to access source files easily by either only using features in the free version of Construct 2, or recreating the interactive with native HTML/CSS/JS.

## Current Issues

- The favicon is set to the Construct 2 icon upon exporting. Needs to be reset after each import.

# Searching Algorithms Interactive

This interactive is created for teaching searching algorithms, in particular binary search.
The interactive has five levels within it, and by default will start at level 0 and play sequentially to level 4.
The available levels can be configured with the following parameters:

- `start-level`: The level number to start on.
- `end-level`: The level number to end on (inclusive).

For example, with the parameters `?start-level=3&end-level=4` will run only levels 3 and 4.

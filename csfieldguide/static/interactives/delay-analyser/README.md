# Delay Anaylser Interactive

**Original Author:** Rhem Munro  
**Modified By:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for testing users reaction times and showing what they perceive as a delay. The interactive provides statistics after running the experiment to show what delays the user perceived.

The original code was provided by Rhem Munro (around 2012/2013), and was modified to fit the new CSFG requirements (responsive design, etc) by Jack Morgan (in 2015).

## Instructions

- Click on any tile of the grid. This will reveal a small tile of a larger image.
- If you perceived any delay in the tile being revealed, in other words 'it didn't feel like it appeared instantly' then click on this tile again. The tile will be coloured green, indicating that you have decided there was a perceivable delay.
- If you made a mistake by clicking it, you can change your mind by clicking again.
- Repeat this on all other cells to reveal the complete image.
- View the statistics page to see experiment results.

You can reset the test anytime by refreshing the page.

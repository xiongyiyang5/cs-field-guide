# Sorting Algorithms Interactive

**Original Author:** Jack Morgan
**Modified by:** Hayley van Waas, Alasdair Smith

This interactive is created for teaching sorting algorithms, mostly selection, quick, and merge sort.

The interactive will run with 1 row (used for selection sort) by default.
To use the interactive with 2 rows (used for merge and quick sort), add `?method=quick` at the end of the URL.
A second row of boxes can also be shown/hidden with a button press.

## Dependencies

The interactive uses [Dragula](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula) for intuitive drag and drop behaviour.
Its licence is listed in `LICENCE-THIRD-PARTY` with a full copy available in the `third-party-licences` directory.

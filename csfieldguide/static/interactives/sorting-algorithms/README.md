# Sorting Algorithms Interactive

**Original Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for teaching sorting algorithms, mostly selection, quick, and merge sort.

The interactive will run with 1 row (used for selection sort) by default.
To use the interactive with 2 rows (used for merge and quick sort), add `?method=quick` at the end of the URL.

## Dependencies

The interactive uses [Dragula](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula) for intuitive drag and drop behaviour.

## Future Plans

- Allow switching between 1 row (used for selection sort) and 2 rows (used for merge and quick sort) within the program.

# Deceiver Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for the HCI chapter in giving the user experience with an awful interface. The user must answer as many questions as they can in 15 seconds, however the 'Yes' and 'No' buttons switch after a random amount of times.

## Required Files

The interactive loads from a base website template which includes a JavaScript file containing jQuery, Bootstrap, and a few other utilities and polyfills.
See `static/js/website.js` for a full list.

## Future Plans

- The JavaScript should be checked over for efficiency (as I'm still learning).

This interactive demonstrates how small changes in selection and perception can change the result of a study or competition.
The user will learn how to better view data by altering their perspective.

## The interactive

The user is presented with a number of coloured circles placed on a coloured background and is asked to click the visible circles.
Some circles are the same colour as the background and therefore near impossible to find.
The interactive then reveals the hidden circles and allows the user to change the background colour via a slider.

## Licences

The licence of the original interactive can be found in `LICENCE-THIRD-PARTY` with a full copy available in the `third-party-licences` directory.

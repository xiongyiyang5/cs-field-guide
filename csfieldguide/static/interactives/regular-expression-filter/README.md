# Regular Expression Word Filter Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for users to write regular expressions, to filter words from a given list. The list of words used is used from [atebits/Words](https://github.com/atebits/Words), an open source list of words available under a [CC0 1.0 Universal license](https://github.com/atebits/Words/blob/master/LICENSE) (the alpha of the interactive used a list from [Interociter bulletin board](https://web.archive.org/web/20180803153208/http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/)).

NOTE: The words contained in en-words.txt are not translated because the interactive is about string matching, thus it doesn't matter what language the words are in.


## Required Files

- This interactive uses jQuery and MaterializeCSS (loaded from base-files folder).

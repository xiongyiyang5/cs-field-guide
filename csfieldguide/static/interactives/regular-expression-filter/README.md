# Regular Expression Word Filter Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for users to write regular expressions, to filter words from a given list.

NOTE: The words contained in en-words.txt are not translated because the interactive is about string matching, thus it doesn't matter what language the words are in.

## Licences

The list of words used is used from [atebits/Words](https://github.com/atebits/Words), its `CC0 1.0 Universal licence` is listed in the `LICENCE-THIRD-PARTY` file, with a full copy available in the `third-party-licences` directory.
Early versions of the interactive used a list from [Interociter bulletin board](https://web.archive.org/web/20180803153208/http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/), this is no longer used.

# Image Bit Comparer Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created to compare an image at different bit settings.

## Usage

The interactive has two modes:

1. Comparison Mode - Allows comparing multiple bits levels of a single image. Defaults to this mode.
2. Change Bits Mode - Provides two images which allow the maximum bit values to be set. Accessed by appending `?change-bits=true` to the end of the URL.

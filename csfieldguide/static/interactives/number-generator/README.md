**Original Author:** Hayley van Waas  
**Modified By:** Jack Morgan

This interactive generates example codes for:

- ISBN10
- ISBN13
- GTIN-13
- European train carriages
- IRD numbers

Two valid numbers, two invalid numbers, and one of either valid or invalid are generated. The output is provided in an random order. To be used alongside the checksum-calculator interactive.

## Required Files

The interactive loads from a base website template which includes a JavaScript file containing jQuery, Bootstrap, and a few other utilities and polyfills.
See `static/js/website.js` for a full list.

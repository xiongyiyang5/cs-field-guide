# Python Interpreter

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive allows the user to run Python code within their browser using the [Skulpt](https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt) library.

## Licences

The interactive uses the Skulpt library.
Its licence is listed in `LICENCE-THIRD-PARTY` with a full copy available in the `third-party-licences` directory.

## Known Issues

- The function of the Tab key is overridden to replace text (with extra spaces) instead of tabbing to the next HTML element.
As a result, if Tab is pressed the undo command cannot undo it nor any change made before it.

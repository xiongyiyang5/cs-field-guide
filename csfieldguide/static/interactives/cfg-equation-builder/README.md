**Author:** Alasdair Smith

This interactive demonstrates a context-free grammar (CFG) by allowing a user to use it to build a mathematical equation.

## URL Parameters

Parameters, particularly the grammar, should have all non-unreserved characters [percent-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).
Integers can only be terminal.

## Required files

The interactive loads from a base website template which includes a JavaScript file containing jQuery, Bootstrap, and a few other utilities and polyfills.

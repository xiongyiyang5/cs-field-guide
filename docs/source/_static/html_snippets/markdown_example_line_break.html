<p>Here's a line for us to start with.</p>

<p>This line is separated from the one above by two newlines in the markdown file, so it will be a <b>separate paragraph</b>.</p>

<p>This line is also a separate paragraph.
However, <i>this</i> line is only separated by a single newline in the markdown file, so it's a new sentence that will appear <b>on the same line</b> as the previous one.</p>

<p>When writing markdown, new sentences belonging to the same paragraph should be started on a new line for clarity.
An exception is for really small sentences like this:
Is it one? two? three?</p>

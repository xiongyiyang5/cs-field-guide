Writing Style
==============================================================================

When using pronouns in reference to a hypothetical person, gender neutral pronouns (they/their/them) should be used.

All documents (other than those for internal use only) must be written clearly and simply so that a non-expert is able to understand them.
Preferably documents should be readable by students.

Any jargon used needs to be clearly explained and should be considered as a glossary definition.

Capitalisation Rules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO: Check capitalisation rules (I don't think we capitalise computer science) also these are CSU terms
In the majority of cases capitalisation should not be used for keywords and titles, with the following exceptions, where the phrase refers to a commonly used term that is often capitilised in the literature:

- Computer Science.
- Computational Thinking.
- Digital Technologies (note that this is the correct form to refer to the subject area in NZ, with caps and plural; if it's referring to something other than the subject then use lower case e.g. "smartphones and other digital technologies", or even better, avoid the phrase e.g. "smartphones and other digital devices").
- Sorting Network.
- Numeracy.
- Literacy.

The following wouldn't be capitalised:
binary number(s), digits, binary digits

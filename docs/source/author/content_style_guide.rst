Writing Style
==============================================================================

When using pronouns in reference to a hypothetical person, gender neutral pronouns (they/their/them) should be used.

All documents (other than those for internal use only) must be written clearly and simply so that a non-expert is able to understand them.
Preferably documents should be readable by students.

Any jargon used needs to be clearly explained and should be considered as a glossary definition.

Capitalisation Rules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the majority of cases capitalisation should not be used for keywords and titles.

The following wouldn't be capitalised:
binary number(s), digits, binary digits

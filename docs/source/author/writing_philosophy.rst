- how we present material: 
    - Chapters cover a key area of computer science 
        - contain an intro page and several chapter sections that each cover a key sub area of the main chapter topic
        - always end with 'the whole story' section which is a summary of the chapter and a further reading section which contains links/book references 
          where students can read further about the topic
    
    - Interactives

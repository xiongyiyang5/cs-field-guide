Static Files
##############################################################################

The static files (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc) used within the website go through the following steps:

1. Files are stored within the ``static`` directory.
2. Files are processed with a Gulpfile into the ``build`` directory with ``./csfg dev static`` or ``./csfg dev static_prod``.
3. Files are collected into the ``staticfiles`` directory with ``./csfg dev collect_static``.

Every interactive and uninteractive has a generated thumbnail stored in ``static/img/interactives/thumbnails/``. These can be generated with ``./csfg make_interactive_thumbnails``

JavaScript Files
==============================================================================

JavaScript files are processed with `Browserify <http://browserify.org/>`_ to allow loading modules from NPM.

Any modules used must be listed with a ``package.json`` file within the directory, with the ``package.json`` file listed in the ``csfieldguide/package.json`` file (see examples already within this file).

If you wish to not apply optimisation steps (`Browserify <http://browserify.org/>`_, minification, etc), then list the files within the ``js_files_skip_optimisation`` constant within ``csfieldguide/gulpfile.js``.

Any files within the ``csfieldguide/static/js/modules/`` directory are skipped by the Gulpfile and not processed by themselves.
Module files can be required by other JavaScript files to be included.

If NPM modules are added, modified, or deleted, the Docker images will need to be rebuilt using ``./csfg dev build``.

Django's `JavaScript translation catalog <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-javascript-code>`_ enables the use of gettext() in JavaScript files to translate text.
The JavaScript translation files are prepared before server start.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I report a typo or make a suggestion?

There are two possible ways to do this:

1. If you have a GitHub account, please [log an issue](https://github.com/uccser/cs-field-guide/issues) (but do a quick search the issue doesn't exist already!) and label it appropriately (e.g. add the suggestion label if you're logging an idea).
2. If you don't have a GitHub account, [log your feedback in our form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gCOwTMAd6idaeIRwvIELARfQsyL6lpI5P4EQa9bIW9w/viewform).

# FSA Washing Machine Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan
**Artwork:** Sarang Love Leehan

This interactive is created for learning FSAs.

The interactive displays a washing machine with a spin button, allowing the user
to traverse a FSA while viewing the spin setting.

This interactive is not feature complete so will currently not handle all FSA possibilities, however it provides all logic for the simple example requires.

## Usage

This interactive does not use configuration files (unlike `fsa-light` and 
`fsa-box`) so can be run in any interactive mode.

## Required files

- This interactive uses MaterializeCSS, Modernizer, and jQuery (all loaded from base-files folder).

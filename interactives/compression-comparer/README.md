# Compression Comparer Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for the compression chapter to show the user the difference between two images stored at different file sizes.

The code used for the slider is adapted from [before-after.js](https://github.com/jotform/before-after.js), used under the MIT License.

The images used are taken by [Jack Morgan](https://github.com/JackMorganNZ) and used with permission, under the CSFG license. The original source image (a 20MB CR2 file) can be found within the [uccser-extras repo](https://github.com/uccser/uccser-extras). The photos are of Lake Rotoiti in New Zealand.

## Required Files

- This interactive uses jQuery (loaded from base-files folder).

## Future Plans

- Allow users to upload an image, compress a copy of the image and compare the two.

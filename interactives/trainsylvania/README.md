# Trainsylvania Interactive

**Original Author:** David Thompson
**Modified By:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for teaching finite state automata. The original interactive has been completely rewritten for the v2.0 of the Computer Science Field Guide, however the same principles have been used.

Images for Trainsylvania were created by David Thompson and are freely available under the MIT license (email [Jack Morgan](mailto:jack.morgan@canterbury.ac.nz) for details).

## Required Files

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) (loaded from base-files folder)

## Future Plans

- Update images (see [#92](https://github.com/uccser/cs-field-guide/issues/92)).
- Use CSS animations rather than JQuery `.animate()`.
- Calculate height of image box on load, rather than hard coded by CSS.
- Improve aesthetics by adding train moving on train tracks in front of stations, with a parallax background.
- Change name of stations to fit theme.

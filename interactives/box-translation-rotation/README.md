# WebGL 3D Translating and Rotating Boxes

**Author:** Hayley van Waas

These interactives show how to move objects in a 3D space, through translation and rotation.

## Required files

This folder contains the source code for two interactives: one for translation and one for rotation.
Both interactives share the exact same source files apart from one additional js file (translation-script.js or rotation-script.js).
All source files are loaded from within this folder (i.e. no files are used from base-files/).

## Licenses
The third-party libraries Three.js and tween.js are used in these interactives, their corresponding licence files are included in this folder.
The json object file was obtained as part of the Three.js library, and its use is covered under the same licence.

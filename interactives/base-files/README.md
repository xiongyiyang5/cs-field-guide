# Base Files Folder

This folder is used for two purposes:

1. A template for new interactives
2. Storing common base files for interactives (Foundation, jQuery, etc)

## Interactive Template

Details about how to use this folder as an interactive template can be found on this [wiki page](https://github.com/uccser/cs-field-guide/wiki/Creating-interactives#interactive-template).

## Base Files

This folder is also used to view interactives displayed on a page by themselves, as it stores common base files (Foundation, jQuery, etc). When viewing an interactive by itself (for example, the `deceiver` folder), you must also copy the `base-files` folder into the same directory.

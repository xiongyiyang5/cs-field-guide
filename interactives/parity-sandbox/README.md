# Parity Sandbox Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created as a sandbox environment for the parity trick.

## Required files

- This interactive uses MaterializeCSS, Modernizer, and jQuery (all loaded from base-files folder).

## Possible future plans

- Add clear button to turn all cards white.
- Add random data button that fills in cards with random values (not parity row).
- Add highlight showing parity error, however this stops opportunities for learning.

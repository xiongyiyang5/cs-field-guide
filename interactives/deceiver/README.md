# Deceiver Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for the HCI chapter in giving the user experience with an awful interface. The user must answer as many questions as they can in 15 seconds, however the 'Yes' and 'No' buttons switch after a random amount of times.

## Required Files

- This interactive uses jQuery (loaded from base-files folder)

## Future Plans

- The JavaScript should be checked over for efficiency (as I'm still learning).

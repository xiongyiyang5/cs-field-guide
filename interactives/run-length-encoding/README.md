# Run Length Encoding Interactive

**Original Author:** Hannah Taylor  
**Modified By:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for showing users how basic images can be stored with the run length encoding compression method. Encoding numbers should be separated with commas (and spaces if desired) and each row on a new line.

The original code was provided by Hannah Taylor ([original program available here](http://taylormade.io/run-length-encoding.html)) with permission given to use in the CSFG. The existing program will be modified to fit the new CSFG requirements (responsive design, etc).


## Required Files

- This interactive uses jQuery (loaded from base-files folder).

## Possible future Plans

- Allow last digit to be missing. For example, in a grid 5 wide, the numbers '2, 1' would signify 2 white, then 1 black, then the rest black.
- More complex CSS theme.
- Write instructions panel.

# Colour Matcher Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for users to learn the difference between 24 bit and 8 bit colour.
The user can perfectly match the goal colour using 24 bit values, however it's harder to match using 8 bit values.
The the goal colour is picked to be impossible to match perfectly with 8 bit values.

## Required files

- This interactive uses MaterializeCSS, Modernizer, and jQuery (all loaded from base-files folder).

## Future Plans

- Show the colours values in a byte structure below the sliders.
- Make the instruction panels collapsible.
- Reorganise the colour panels so the current colour values only compare to the goal panel, and not each other.

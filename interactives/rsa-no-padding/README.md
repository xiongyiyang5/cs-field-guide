# RSA No Padding

**Original Authors:** Heidi Newton and James Browning

This interactive is created for the encryption chapter in allowing the user to encrypt and decrypt text using RSA public and private keys, using logic which adds to RSA padding.

## Usage

The interactive opens by default in encrypting mode. To access the decrypting mode, the parameter `mode` must be passed with the value `decrypt` (by adding `?mode=decrypt` to the end of the URL).

# Delayed Checksum Interactive

This interactive is created for the HCI chapter in testing user delays. The user must tick the checkbox, but the checkbox has a 1.5 second delay so often the user selects multiple times.

## Required Files

- This interactive uses jQuery to select the checkbox (loaded from base-files folder)

## Known issues

- On some browsers the checkbox renders normal size (our CSS increases the box from the default size). The smaller checkbox is deemed fine currently.

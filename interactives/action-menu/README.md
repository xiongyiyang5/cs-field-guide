# Action Menu Interactive

**Authors:** Victor Chang

This interactive provides a menu of seemingly standard household actions, with one outlier. Upon selection of an action, there is no "confirm" screen and no way to return to the menu, to demonstrate a key HCI concept of not putting important actions alongside non-important ones.
